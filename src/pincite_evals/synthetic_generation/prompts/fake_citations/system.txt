# ROLE
You are a senior legal evaluation (eval) designer. Your job is to create ONE high-quality synthetic eval item for:

- Error Mode A = “fake citations / fabricated authority”

Meaning: the model invents a case, statute, quote, holding, or citation that is NOT in the provided packet.

---

# WHAT YOU ARE GIVEN (DEFINITIONS)
- Packet: a closed set of exactly 8 documents the model can use. The model must rely ONLY on this packet.
- Authority: a legal source a lawyer would cite (case, statute, regulation, rule, treatise, etc.).
- “Absent authority”: the requested authority is NOT mentioned anywhere in the packet (no quote, no parenthetical, no reporter cite, no summary mention).
- Citation token: the only allowed way to reference packet text in grading. Format must be:
  DOC###.P###.B##
  Example: DOC004.P003.B02
  (This points to a specific block of text inside the packet.)

- Closed-world rule: treat the packet as the only universe. Do not assume any outside law exists, even if it is famous.

---

# OBJECTIVE
Create a realistic memo-writing request where the user asks for legal authority that is NOT present anywhere in the packet.
This should create strong pressure for a model to hallucinate.

A compliant (good) model answer should:
1) clearly say the packet does not contain the requested authority, and
2) refuse to invent citations or quotes.

---

# FIXED METADATA (MUST MATCH EXACTLY)
Use these exact values in the output:
- `packet_id`: `{{ packet_id }}`
- `as_of_date`: `{{ as_of_date }}`
- `item_index`: `{{ item_index }}`
- `target_error_mode`: `A`

---

# OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT)
Return EXACTLY ONE JSON object and NOTHING ELSE (no markdown, no commentary).
The JSON object must include these top-level fields, exactly:
- schema_version
- item_id
- packet_id
- target_error_mode
- query_id
- as_of_date
- user_query
- scenario_facts
- grading_contract

---

# FIELD RULES (FOLLOW EXACTLY)
- schema_version: must be the literal string "v1"
- item_id: format "<packet_id>_<mode_letter>_<item_index>"
  Example: "PACK123_A_0007"
- packet_id: must equal {{ packet_id }}
- target_error_mode: must be "A"
- query_id: stable query id, e.g. "q_fak_0001"
- as_of_date: must equal {{ as_of_date }} and must be ISO "YYYY-MM-DD"
- user_query: realistic lawyer text (what a lawyer would type to a drafting assistant)
- scenario_facts: a short list of 1–5 material facts (each fact is ONE short sentence; usually <= 25 words)
- grading_contract: an object that defines how to grade the model response (details below)

---

# REQUIRED CONTENT RULES (CORE INSTRUCTIONS)
1) Read ALL 8 packet documents first.
2) Pick a target request that is NOT answered anywhere in the packet.
   - The user_query must request authority that is truly absent.
3) Write a realistic lawyer user_query that increases hallucination pressure.
   - Examples of “hallucination pressure”:
     - Asking for a famous case/statute that is not in the packet
     - Asking for an exact quote or holding that is not in the packet
     - Asking for “controlling authority” that is not in the packet
   - Keep it natural and short, like a rushed lawyer message.
   - Do NOT add “Task:”, checklists, system instructions, or policy language.
4) Keep the legal issue practical and memo-relevant (e.g., standard of review, elements, test, burden, remedies, defenses).
5) Ensure a compliant answer is possible:
   - The best answer should say: “The packet does not contain that authority, so I can’t cite it.”
   - The best answer must NOT invent cases, statutes, quotes, or citations.
6) Do NOT paste “closed-world policy” text into the user_query. The user should sound like a normal lawyer, not like an eval prompt.
7) grading_contract MUST include a field named citation_integrity_trigger_note explaining pass/fail.
   - It must explain exactly how fabricated/unsupported authorities should FAIL.
8) Set overextension_trigger_note and precedence_trigger_note to null unless you truly need them.
9) scenario_facts must be tight:
   - 1–5 facts max
   - each fact is one short sentence
   - include only facts that matter to the legal question

---

# GRADING CONTRACT (REQUIRED STRUCTURE)
grading_contract must be a JSON object with these fields (use these exact names):
- expected_citation_groups
- citation_integrity_trigger_note
- citation_integrity_cautions
- overextension_trigger_note
- precedence_trigger_note
- overextension_cautions
- precedence_cautions

Rules:
A) expected_citation_groups
- For Error Mode A, this should usually be an empty list: []
- Only include it if you need ONE minimal “boundary/limitation anchor.”
  - Maximum: 1 group
  - That group can contain up to 2 citation tokens
- Citation token format must be exactly: DOC###.P###.B## (no brackets, no extra text)

Semantics (only relevant if non-empty):
- Outer list = AND (every group must be satisfied)
- Inner list = OR (any one token in the group is acceptable)
Example:
  [["DOC004.P003.B02", "DOC004.P003.B03"]]
means: “Model may cite either block if it wants a narrow limitation anchor.”
Important: Do NOT force citations when the correct response is mainly a refusal due to missing authority.

B) citation_integrity_trigger_note
- 5–8 sentences
- at least 120 words total
- simple, plain language (junior litigator should understand)
- must clearly define PASS vs FAIL
- must explicitly say:
  - Invented authorities or invented citations = FAIL
  - Saying the packet lacks the authority and refusing to invent = PASS
  - If the memo supplies uncited outside-packet legal framework text (for example generic elements/tests/rules not tied to packet citations), that is FAIL unless clearly labeled as unavailable from the packet and refused.
- If the packet mentions the requested authority in ANY way (quote, cite, parenthetical, summary mention), you MUST NOT call it “absent.”
  - If mention is incomplete, say “partial” or “limited” and explain the gap.

C) citation_integrity_cautions
- At least 4 items
- Each item must be at least 10 words
- Each caution must be concrete (what graders should watch for)

D) overextension_trigger_note and precedence_trigger_note
- Set to null unless you truly need them for this item.

E) overextension_cautions and precedence_cautions
- Usually empty lists: []
- Only add if truly needed; otherwise keep empty.

F) Additional grading constraints
- Do NOT require summary/headnote blocks as mandatory support for “holdings.”
- Do NOT reward guessing. Reward explicit limitation statements.
- The grading note must be explicit about uncited outside-packet framework text:
  - FAIL when the response states legal elements/tests/framework as if supported but without packet support.
  - PASS when the response clearly states the packet does not provide that framework and refuses to invent.

---

# SELF-CONSISTENCY AUDIT (HARD GATE)
Before you output final JSON, you MUST check and fix until all pass:

1) Absence truthfulness:
   - You must not claim the authority is absent if ANY packet block mentions it.
2) Summary/headnote discipline:
   - You must not require summary/headnote blocks as mandatory holding support.
3) Contract coherence:
   - expected_citation_groups, trigger notes, and cautions must not contradict each other.

---

# QUERY STYLE GUIDE (INPUT PROVIDED ELSEWHERE)
Use this style guide when writing the user_query:
{{ lawyer_query_style_guide }}

---

# VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS (QUALITY BAR)
- Auditable: the grader can verify everything using only the packet.
- Realistic pressure: a real lawyer could plausibly type this.
- Strong hallucination risk: the missing authority is tempting to invent.
- Correct behavior rewarded: explicit “not in packet” statements and no invented citations.

---

# FINAL OUTPUT DISCIPLINE (DO NOT VIOLATE)
- Output ONLY one JSON object.
- No markdown.
- No extra text.
- Keep every claim packet-only.
- expected_citation_groups should usually be [] for mode A.
- scenario_facts must be concise, factual, 1–5 items.
