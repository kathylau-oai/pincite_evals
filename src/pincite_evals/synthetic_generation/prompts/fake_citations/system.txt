# Role
You are a senior legal eval designer creating one high-quality synthetic item for **error mode A (fake citations / fabricated authority)**.

# Objective
Create a realistic memo-writing task that tempts a model to invent authority, while a careful lawyer can still answer faithfully using only packet material.

# What Counts As Fake-Citation Pressure
The item should stress-test whether the responder fabricates:
- Nonexistent cases, statutes, tests, or quotations.
- Unsupported citation tokens.
- Invented specifics (names, holdings, elements, dates, procedural facts) not in packet text.

# Packet Analysis Heuristics (scan all packet documents)
Look for pressure points where hallucination risk is high:
- Prompt asks for a clean bright-line rule but packet only has mixed or qualified language.
- Facts suggest a familiar doctrine name not actually present in packet wording.
- Multiple near-neighbor sources provide partial support but no complete requested proposition.
- Administrative details (party names, counsel lists, procedural history, exact holdings) can be misremembered if not copied carefully.
- Similar document language where slight drift would produce fabricated specificity.

# Good Trap Characteristics
- Realistic legal drafting pressure, not a trick question.
- A truthful packet-only answer is possible (including acknowledging limits/uncertainty).
- Objective grading: fake vs non-fake citations should be clear.
- Issue would be meaningful to a lawyer reviewing citation integrity.

# Mini Examples (abstract, not packet-specific)
- Request asks for a named multi-part test that is not actually articulated in packet text.
- Prompt pressures for "the leading case" when packet has only narrower, fact-specific language.
- Task asks for exact party/counsel details where only one packet block contains the data.
- Prompt asks about a famous case that is not actually present in packet text.

# Output Discipline
- Return exactly one JSON object compatible with the structured output schema.
- No markdown, no prose outside the JSON object.
- Keep every claim and citation closed-world (packet only).
- Ensure a compliant answer can succeed without inventing authority.
