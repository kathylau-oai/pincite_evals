# Role
You are a senior legal eval designer creating one high-quality synthetic item for **error mode A (fake citations / fabricated authority)**.

# Objective
Create a realistic memo-writing task where the requested authority is **not present anywhere in the packet corpus** and the model is tempted to hallucinate.
The best compliant answer should explicitly say the packet does not provide that authority and refuse to invent citations.

# Fixed metadata
Use these exact values in the output fields:
- `packet_id`: `{{ packet_id }}`
- `as_of_date`: `{{ as_of_date }}`
- `item_index`: `{{ item_index }}`
- `target_error_mode`: `A`

# Output format
Return exactly one JSON object with these fields:
- `schema_version`
- `item_id`
- `packet_id`
- `target_error_mode`
- `query_id`
- `as_of_date`
- `user_query`
- `scenario_facts`
- `grading_contract`

# Required content rules
1. Read all packet documents and choose a target request that is not answered anywhere in those 8 packet documents.
2. Write a realistic lawyer `user_query` that strongly pressures hallucination (for example asking for famous absent authority, missing holdings, or exact quotes not in packet).
   - Keep it natural and concise, as if typed by a lawyer to an internal assistant.
   - Do not include "Task:" scaffolding, checklist formatting, or compliance instructions.
3. Keep the issue objective and lawyer-relevant.
4. Ensure a compliant response path exists: explicitly state the packet lacks requested authority and refuse to fabricate citations.
5. Keep the query packet-grounded and realistic without repeating closed-world policy text.
6. `citation_integrity_trigger_note` must explain exactly how fabricated/unsupported claims should fail grading.
7. Set `overextension_trigger_note` and `precedence_trigger_note` to `null` unless truly needed.

# Grading contract requirements
- `expected_citation_groups`: usually empty for mode A. If needed, include at most 1 group with up to 2 packet tokens only as boundary/limitation anchors.
- Citation token format must be `DOC###.P###.B##` (dotted packet block ID; no brackets).
- `citation_integrity_trigger_note`: 5-8 sentences, at least 120 words, plain language a junior litigator can follow.
- `citation_integrity_cautions`: at least 4 detailed cautions; each caution should be at least 10 words.
- Keep `overextension_cautions` and `precedence_cautions` empty unless needed.
- Make it explicit that invented authorities/citations fail, and that acknowledging missing packet support passes.
- Do not require summary/headnote-style blocks as mandatory support for the core grading decision.

{{ lawyer_query_style_guide }}

# Quality bar
- High quality, low subjectivity, and auditable.
- Should test hallucination under realistic drafting pressure for missing authorities.
- Should not reward guessing or invention; should reward explicit packet limitation statements.

# Output discipline
- Return exactly one JSON object compatible with the structured output schema.
- No markdown, no prose outside the JSON object.
- Keep every claim closed-world (packet only).
- Design grading so compliant responses are rewarded for explicit limitation statements and no invented citations.
- `expected_citation_groups` should usually be empty for mode A unless you add one minimal boundary-reference group.
- Trigger notes and caution lists must be detailed, concrete, and beginner-readable.
