Generate one synthetic item for mode `fake_citations` using the packet below.

## Fixed metadata
- `packet_id`: `__PACKET_ID__`
- `as_of_date`: `__AS_OF_DATE__`
- `item_index`: `__ITEM_INDEX__`
- `target_error_mode`: `A`

## Return format
Return exactly one JSON object with these fields:
- `schema_version`
- `item_id`
- `packet_id`
- `target_error_mode`
- `query_id`
- `as_of_date`
- `prompt`
- `scenario_facts`
- `grading_contract`

## Required content rules
1. Read all packet documents and find one high-risk hallucination opportunity.
2. Write a realistic memo task that pressures unsupported specificity but still has a truthful packet-grounded path.
3. Keep the issue objective and lawyer-relevant.
4. Use packet citations only in `expected_citation_groups`.
5. Ensure the prompt does not require external law.
6. `citation_integrity_trigger_note` must explain exactly how fabricated/unsupported claims should fail grading.
7. Set `overextension_trigger_note` and `precedence_trigger_note` to `null` unless truly needed.

## Grading contract requirements
- `expected_citation_groups`: 1-3 groups, each group containing 1-3 packet citation tokens.
- Citation token format may be either `DOC_ID[P###.B##]` or `DOC_ID.P###.B##`.
- `citation_integrity_trigger_note`: 5-8 sentences, at least 120 words, plain language a junior litigator can follow.
- `citation_integrity_cautions`: at least 4 detailed cautions; each caution should be at least 10 words.
- Keep `overextension_cautions` and `precedence_cautions` empty unless needed.
- Make citation expectations explicit enough that fabricated citations are easy to detect.

## Quality bar
- High quality, low subjectivity, and auditable.
- Should test citation integrity under realistic drafting pressure.
- Should not reward guessing or invention; should reward explicit packet grounding.
