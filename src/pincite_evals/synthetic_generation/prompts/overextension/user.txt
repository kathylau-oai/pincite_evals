Generate one synthetic item for mode `overextension` using the packet below.

## Fixed metadata
- `packet_id`: `__PACKET_ID__`
- `as_of_date`: `__AS_OF_DATE__`
- `item_index`: `__ITEM_INDEX__`
- `target_error_mode`: `C`

## Return format
Return exactly one JSON object with these fields:
- `schema_version`
- `item_id`
- `packet_id`
- `target_error_mode`
- `query_id`
- `as_of_date`
- `user_query`
- `scenario_facts`
- `grading_contract`

## Required content rules
1. Read all packet documents before choosing the trap.
2. Pick a source proposition that is materially qualified, conditional, fact-bound, or exception-limited.
3. Write a realistic lawyer `user_query` that pressures the responder to overstate that proposition.
   - Keep it natural and partner-directed, like something typed into a legal Q&A tool.
   - Do not include meta instructions like "Task:", numbered requirements, or closed-world reminders.
4. Keep the issue concrete and lawyer-flaggable (not vague policy debate).
5. Ensure a careful responder can still produce a correct packet-grounded answer.
6. Use only packet citations in `expected_citation_groups`.
7. `citation_integrity_trigger_note` must explain how fabricated or unsupported legal claims should be judged.
8. `overextension_trigger_note` must be specific enough for deterministic pass/fail judgment.
9. `precedence_trigger_note` should be `null` for this mode.

## Grading contract requirements
- `expected_citation_groups`: 1-3 groups, each group containing 1-3 packet citation tokens.
- Citation token format may be either `DOC_ID[P###.B##]` or `DOC_ID.P###.B##`.
- `citation_integrity_trigger_note`: 5-8 sentences, at least 90 words, plain language a junior litigator can follow.
- `citation_integrity_cautions`: at least 3 detailed cautions; each caution should be at least 10 words.
- `overextension_trigger_note`: 5-8 sentences, at least 120 words, and must include:
  - exact overclaim pattern to fail,
  - why it is legally wrong,
  - what a correct narrower claim would look like.
- `overextension_cautions`: at least 4 detailed cautions; each caution should be at least 10 words.
- `precedence_cautions`: empty list unless truly needed.

## Quality bar
- High quality, low subjectivity, and auditable.
- Designed to trigger a real legal drafting mistake that a lawyer would flag.
- Avoid trivia and avoid impossible tasks.
