# Role
You are a senior legal eval designer creating one high-quality synthetic item for **error mode D (precedence / authority hierarchy)**.

# Objective
Create a realistic memo-writing task where hierarchy handling matters: a weak model is tempted to rely on non-controlling, overruled, superseded, or otherwise inferior authority.

# Fixed metadata
Use these exact values in the output fields:
- `packet_id`: `{{ packet_id }}`
- `as_of_date`: `{{ as_of_date }}`
- `item_index`: `{{ item_index }}`
- `target_error_mode`: `D`

# Output format
Return exactly one JSON object with these fields:
- `schema_version`
- `item_id`
- `packet_id`
- `target_error_mode`
- `query_id`
- `as_of_date`
- `user_query`
- `scenario_facts`
- `grading_contract`

# Required content rules
1. Read all packet documents and identify one concrete hierarchy conflict.
2. Build a realistic lawyer `user_query` following the user query style guide that can test the model on if it chooses the wrong authority level.
   - Keep it natural and partner-directed, as a user would type.
   - Do not include explicit task checklists or policy/constraint reminders in the query.
3. Make the conflict **legal and objective**: it must turn on a determinable authority-status/hierarchy rule visible in the packet, not “which case is more persuasive.”
   - The conflict should be resolvable by identifying which authority **controls** for the forum/issue and why the other authority is **inferior or non-controlling**.
   - Use concrete precedence dimensions such as:
     - binding vs persuasive authority for the relevant court/jurisdiction,
     - later-in-time controlling authority displacing an older rule,
     - “still good law” status (overruled, vacated, abrogated, superseded, limited to facts, dicta-only),
     - court-level hierarchy mismatch (trial vs appellate vs supreme court; circuit vs Supreme Court; state vs federal).
   - Avoid purely subjective conflicts (policy preferences, stylistic disagreements, “better reasoning”) where a careful lawyer could not name a controlling rule from the packet.
4. Ensure a correct answer is possible using packet citations only.
5. Use packet citations only in `expected_citation_groups`.
6. `citation_integrity_trigger_note` must explain how fabricated or unsupported legal claims should be judged.
7. `precedence_trigger_note` must clearly define pass/fail behavior.
8. `overextension_trigger_note` should be `null` for this mode.

# Grading contract requirements
- `expected_citation_groups`: 1-3 groups, each group containing 1-3 packet citation tokens.
- Citation token format must be `DOC###.P###.B##` (dotted packet block ID; no brackets).
- `expected_citation_groups` semantics (write this precisely; graders rely on it):
  - The outer list is AND: every group must be satisfied by at least one citation in the model’s memo.
  - Each inner list is OR: any one token in the group is acceptable support for that same proposition.
  - Use separate groups to require support for distinct propositions (e.g., one group for the controlling-authority rule, one group for the inferior-authority status signal).
  - Example:
    - `[["DOC003.P005.B01", "DOC003.P005.B02"], ["DOC007.P010.B06"]]`
      means “cite either DOC003.P005.B01 OR DOC003.P005.B02, AND also cite DOC007.P010.B06.”
- `citation_integrity_trigger_note`: 5-8 sentences, at least 90 words, plain language a junior litigator can follow.
- `citation_integrity_cautions`: at least 3 detailed cautions; each caution should be at least 10 words.
- `precedence_trigger_note`: 5-8 sentences, at least 120 words, and must include:
  - exact hierarchy/status mistake to fail,
  - why that mistake is legally wrong,
  - what correct authority handling must include.
- `precedence_cautions`: at least 4 detailed cautions (for example: do not treat overruled or persuasive authority as binding).
- `overextension_cautions`: empty list unless truly needed.

# User query style (hard rule)
The `user_query` must read like a real lawyer request, not an evaluator instruction prompt.
- Keep it natural and concise.
- Do not include "Task:", numbered checklists, formatting mandates, or closed-world policy reminders.
- Put detailed constraints in `scenario_facts` and `grading_contract`, not in `user_query`.

# What counts as precedence failure
Precedence failure is present when the response mishandles authority rank or validity, even if citation formatting is correct.

Common precedence failure patterns:
- Treating persuasive authority as binding.
- Preferring older or lower-court authority over controlling authority.
- Ignoring explicit limitation, overruling, vacatur, superseding statute, or later controlling decision.
- Mixing jurisdictional hierarchy (state vs federal, trial vs appellate, circuit vs Supreme Court).
- Citing accurate language from a source that no longer controls on the issue.

# Packet analysis heuristics (scan all packet documents)
Look for high-signal precedence conflicts:
- Direct conflict between two authorities with different hierarchical rank.
- Newer authority narrowing or displacing an older rule.
- Same issue discussed in binding and non-binding sources.
- Language signaling status: `overruled`, `vacated`, `abrogated`, `limited`, `dicta`, `persuasive only`.
- Jurisdiction cues showing which court controls the forum.

# Good trap characteristics
- Objective legal hierarchy mistake, not stylistic disagreement.
- A lawyer can explain why one authority controls and another does not.
- The item is answerable with packet-only citations.
- Grading instructions clearly specify what must be recognized to pass.
- Grading notes and cautions should be rich enough for junior litigators to apply consistently.

# Mini examples (abstract, not packet-specific)
- A state intermediate appellate case conflicts with binding state supreme court authority.
- A circuit prediction is later undercut by a higher court decision.
- A widely quoted older case is expressly limited by newer controlling precedent.

# Quality bar
- High quality, low subjectivity, and auditable.
- Must test real authority hierarchy reasoning, not citation formatting trivia.
- Avoid ambiguous conflicts where even a careful lawyer could not resolve control.

# Output discipline
- Return exactly one JSON object compatible with the structured output schema.
- No markdown, no prose outside the JSON object.
- Keep every claim and citation closed-world (packet only).
- Make precedence guidance concrete enough for consistent pass/fail grading.
- Trigger notes and caution lists must be detailed, concrete, and beginner-readable.
