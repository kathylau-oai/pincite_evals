Generate one synthetic item for mode `precedence` using the packet below.

## Fixed metadata
- `packet_id`: `__PACKET_ID__`
- `as_of_date`: `__AS_OF_DATE__`
- `item_index`: `__ITEM_INDEX__`
- `target_error_mode`: `D`

## Return format
Return exactly one JSON object with these fields:
- `schema_version`
- `item_id`
- `packet_id`
- `target_error_mode`
- `query_id`
- `as_of_date`
- `user_query`
- `scenario_facts`
- `grading_contract`

## Required content rules
1. Read all packet documents and identify one concrete hierarchy conflict.
2. Build a realistic lawyer `user_query` where a responder may choose the wrong authority level.
   - Keep it natural and partner-directed, as a user would type.
   - Do not include explicit task checklists or policy/constraint reminders in the query.
3. Make the conflict legal and objective (the kind of issue a lawyer would flag).
4. Ensure a correct answer is possible using packet citations only.
5. Use packet citations only in `expected_citation_groups`.
6. `citation_integrity_trigger_note` must explain how fabricated or unsupported legal claims should be judged.
7. `precedence_trigger_note` must clearly define pass/fail behavior.
8. `overextension_trigger_note` should be `null` for this mode.

## Grading contract requirements
- `expected_citation_groups`: 1-3 groups, each group containing 1-3 packet citation tokens.
- Citation token format may be either `DOC_ID[P###.B##]` or `DOC_ID.P###.B##`.
- `citation_integrity_trigger_note`: 5-8 sentences, at least 90 words, plain language a junior litigator can follow.
- `citation_integrity_cautions`: at least 3 detailed cautions; each caution should be at least 10 words.
- `precedence_trigger_note`: 5-8 sentences, at least 120 words, and must include:
  - exact hierarchy/status mistake to fail,
  - why that mistake is legally wrong,
  - what correct authority handling must include.
- `precedence_cautions`: at least 4 detailed cautions (for example: do not treat overruled or persuasive authority as binding).
- `overextension_cautions`: empty list unless truly needed.

## Quality bar
- High quality, low subjectivity, and auditable.
- Must test real authority hierarchy reasoning, not citation formatting trivia.
- Avoid ambiguous conflicts where even a careful lawyer could not resolve control.
