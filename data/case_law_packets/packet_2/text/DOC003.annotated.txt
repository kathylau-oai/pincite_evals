IKUTA, Circuit Judge: Aegis Senior Communities, LLC, appeals from the
district court’s order denying its motion to compel arbitration. 
Because Aegis knew of its right to compel arbitration, but

plaintiffs incurred costs as a direct result, the district court did
not err in concluding that Aegis waived its right to arbitrate.

all operated by Aegis Senior Communities, LLC (Aegis). 1
Each of them (through a representative holding a valid power

included an arbitration provision.  The provision stated “that
any legal claim or civil action arising out of or relating to care
or services provided” by Aegis “will be determined by
submission to arbitration as provided in accordance with
California law.” Notwithstanding her arbitration agreement, Newirth filed
a class action complaint against Aegis in California state

Aegis removed the complaint to district court in July 2016,
and filed a motion to compel arbitration as well as a motion
to dismiss a week later.

<BLOCK id="DOC003.P005.B02">
Instead of pursuing these motions, however, Aegis and Newirth filed a stipulated agreement a week later. Pursuant to the stipulation, Newirth filed a second amended complaint in August 2016, adding additional plaintiffs. 3 For its part, Aegis withdrew its motion to compel arbitration and its motion to dismiss. In September 2016, it filed a new motion to dismiss the second amended complaint, in which it made no mention of arbitration or the arbitration agreements. The following day, the parties filed an agreement stating they were attempting mediation of their dispute. 4 Over the next 11 months, while the second motion

included a proposed schedule for discovery, class certification

2016, the parties served their initial disclosures.  In the early
stages of discovery, Aegis disclosed a copy of the relevant
agreements with Newirth, Pierce, and Feinberg; each
agreement included an arbitration provision initialed by the
party’s representative.

later that month. 5   The remaining parties continued to meet

The district court finally denied Aegis’s pending motion
to dismiss Newirth’s second amended complaint in May
2017.  Aegis filed a new motion to compel arbitration two
months later, almost a year after it had withdrawn its initial
motion to compel arbitration.

In September 2017, the district court denied Aegis’s

Congress enacted the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) in 1925 “in response to a perception that courts were unduly hostile to arbitration.” Epic Sys. Corp. v. Lewis , 138 S. Ct. 1612, 1621 (2018). The Act provides that arbitration agreements “shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.” 9 U.S.C. § 2.

Although arbitration agreements are subject to general contract principles such as waiver, a “[w]aiver of a contractual right to arbitration is not favored,” and “any party arguing waiver of arbitration bears a heavy burden of proof.” 7 Fisher v. A.G. Becker Paribas Inc. , 791 F.2d 691, 694 (9th Cir. 1986) (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, where the waiver of the right to compel arbitration implicates questions of arbitrability that “affect the allocation of power” between a court and arbitrator, we have applied a federal law standard for determining whether an arbitration agreement has been waived.

The parties do not dispute that the federal standard applies here. 8 7 Because Newirth does not rely on California’s longstanding rule that a party may waive a contract right, see Roesch v.

8  The parties also do not dispute that a court, rather than an arbitrator,
should determine whether Aegis waived the right to arbitration.  If parties
to a contract want an arbitrator to decide the question of waiver, “they
must place clear and unmistakable language to that effect in the
agreement.”   Martin v. Yasuda , 829 F.3d 1118, 1124 (9th Cir. 2016). 
Here, the parties’ contract does not clearly and unmistakably provide that
the arbitrator will decide the question of waiver.

9 Under federal law, waiver is “the intentional
relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.”   Hamer v.
Neighborhood Hous. Servs. of Chi. , 138 S. Ct. 13, 17 n.1
(2017) (internal quotation marks omitted).  A party seeking
to prove that the right to compel arbitration has been waived
must carry the heavy burden of demonstrating: (1) knowledge
of an existing right to compel arbitration; (2) intentional acts
inconsistent with that existing right; and (3) prejudice to the
person opposing arbitration from such inconsistent acts. 
Fisher , 791 F.2d at 694.
</BLOCK>

Aegis does not dispute that it knew it had a right to
compel arbitration with Newirth.  Therefore, we consider
only the second and third elements of waiver.

A
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P009.B04">
We first consider Newirth’s argument that Aegis intentionally took actions inconsistent with the right to compel arbitration of Newirth’s claims. “There is no concrete test to determine whether a party has engaged in acts that are inconsistent with its right to arbitrate,” Martin v. Yasuda , 829 F.3d 1118, 1125 (9th Cir. 2016); rather, we consider the totality of the parties’ actions, see id. at 1126. Applying this holistic approach, we have generally asked whether a party’s actions “indicate a conscious decision . . . to seek judicial judgment on the merits of [the] arbitrable claims, which would be inconsistent
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P009.B05">
with a right to arbitrate.” Id. at 1125 (internal quotation marks omitted) (second alteration in original). That is, a party acts inconsistently with exercising the right to arbitrate when it (1) makes an intentional decision not to move to compel arbitration and (2) actively litigates the merits of a case for a

N EWIRTH V . A EGIS S ENIOR C OMMUNITIES 10 prolonged period of time in order to take advantage of being in court. Seeking a decision on the merits of a key issue in a case indicates an intentional and strategic decision to take advantage of the judicial forum. Id. at 1126. For example, in Van Ness Townhouses v. Mar Industries Corp. , we concluded that the defendant acted inconsistently with its known arbitration right when it made an intentional decision to refrain from filing a motion to compel arbitration (because it did not want to sever the arbitrable
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P010.B02">
claims from the nonarbitrable claims), and litigated the arbitrable claims for two years in federal court, including filing a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. 862 F.2d 754, 756, 759 (9th Cir. 1988). Similarly, in Martin v. Yasuda , we concluded that the defendants acted inconsistently with pursuing arbitration when they spent seventeen months actively litigating their case in federal court, including filing a motion to dismiss “on a key merits issue.” 829 F.3d at 1126. Again, the record established that the defendants in Martin intentionally refrained from filing a motion to compel arbitration: when the district
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P010.B03">
court asked defendants’ counsel directly whether he intended to move to compel arbitration, counsel responded: “[W]e haven’t made a decision about that. And frankly . . . I think our view of it is we are probably better off just being here in the court with the procedures of Rule 23 and discovery and federal practice than handling it in arbitration.” Id. at 1122 (alterations in original). 9
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P010.B04">
9  In a slightly different context, we have held that when a defendant
with a non-mandatory arbitration agreement litigated its claims to a verdict
in trial court, it acted inconsistently with its known right to timely demand
arbitration.   See Gutierrez v. Wells Fargo Bank, NA , 704 F.3d 712, 721–22
(9th Cir. 2012).

N EWIRTH V . A EGIS S ENIOR C OMMUNITIES 11 Conversely, parties do not act inconsistently with a right to compel arbitration when they engage in litigation activities that do not evince a decision to take advantage of the judicial forum. Thus Britton v. Co-op Banking Group held that a defendant who resisted discovery requests, pursued a court- appointed attorney, and applied for in forma pauperis status, did not act inconsistently with his right to arbitrate. 916 F.2d 1405, 1413 (9th Cir. 1990). Such actions reflected only a “determination to avoid or frustrate the litigation” rather than a strategic
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P011.B02">
decision to “active[ly] litigat[e],” i.e., to forgo the right to compel arbitration and take advantage of a judicial forum. Id. Even “filing a motion to dismiss that does not address the merits of the case is not sufficient to constitute an inconsistent act.” Martin , 829 F.3d at 1125; 10 see also In re Mirant Corp. , 613 F.3d 584, 589 (5th Cir. 2010) (concluding that a party did not waive its right to compel arbitration unless that party “at the very least” had engaged “in some overt act in court that evinces a desire to resolve the arbitrable dispute
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P011.B03">
through litigation rather than arbitration”). Likewise, where it would have been “futile [at the time] to file a motion to compel arbitration” under then-existing law, even a defendant’s active litigation for three and a half years is not inconsistent with a known right to compel arbitration. Fisher , 791 F.2d at 695; accord Letizia v. Prudential Bache Secs., Inc. , 802 F.2d 1185, 1187 & n.3 (9th Cir. 1986). Conversely, when a defendant successfully opposed a plaintiff’s initial demand for arbitration, the plaintiff’s subsequent pursuit of a remedy in federal court was not inconsistent with its known
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P011.B04">
10  Thus, moving to dismiss a complaint without prejudice or moving
to dismiss an action on jurisdictional or res judicata grounds is not
inconsistent with a known right to compel arbitration because such
motions do not seek a judicial determination on the merits.   See Martin ,
829 F.3d at 1125–1126 & n.4.
</BLOCK>

[Page 12]
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P012.B01">

12 right to arbitrate, and the plaintiff could therefore pursue a
renewed arbitration demand at a later date.   See United States
v. Park Place Assocs., Ltd. , 563 F.3d 907, 921 (9th Cir.
2009).  In context, such actions do not evince an intentional
decision to forgo arbitration in favor of a judicial forum.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P012.B02">
Applying this framework, Newirth carried her burden of showing that Aegis took actions inconsistent with its known right to arbitrate. Although Aegis promptly filed a motion to compel arbitration, Aegis intentionally withdrew the motion and proceeded to take advantage of the federal forum by filing a motion to dismiss Newirth’s arbitrable claims, with prejudice, for failure to state a claim. As we have explained, “[w]hen defendants move for dismissal with prejudice on a key merits issue that would preclude relief as to one or more of plaintiffs’ claims . . . they are seeking a ruling on the merits.” Martin
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P012.B03">
, 829 F.3d at 1126 n.4. Only after receiving an adverse ruling on this motion did Aegis refile the motion to compel arbitration that it had withdrawn a year earlier. Under the totality of these circumstances, we conclude that Aegis knowingly decided to defer its right to compel arbitration to avail itself of the benefits of the federal court forum, an intentional action inconsistent with its known right to compel arbitration.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P012.B04">
Aegis makes several arguments to avoid this conclusion. 
First, it argues that it never expressly waived its right to
compel arbitration.  But parties to a contract can impliedly
waive a right, so long as the parties’ actions amount to a
knowing relinquishment of that right.   See Van Ness ,
862 F.2d at 759.  Second, Aegis argues that its initial filing of
a motion to compel arbitration is evidence that it did not
intend to waive the right.  But again, Aegis’s withdrawal of
the motion to compel arbitration and failure to renew it for a
</BLOCK>

[Page 13]
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P013.B01">
N EWIRTH V . A EGIS  S ENIOR  C OMMUNITIES
13 year while it sought a determination on the merits provides
strong support for Newirth’s argument that Aegis
intentionally waived its right to compel arbitration.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P013.B02">
Third, Aegis argues that it “engaged in only the minimum
amount of litigation activity required . . .  to comply with its
obligations under the applicable court rules and orders, and
therefore did not act inconsistently with its right to arbitrate.” 
This argument also fails.  Aegis could have filed a renewed
motion to compel arbitration at any time after withdrawing its
initial motion, but waited a year to do so.  In the meantime,
Aegis sought a judgment on the merits from the district court. 
Nor did Aegis avail itself of local rules that would have
allowed it to seek relief from case management and discovery
obligations.   See  N.D. Cal. Civil L.R. 16-2(d).
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P013.B03">
Finally, Aegis argues that the one-year delay in filing its second motion to dismiss was not inconsistent with its arbitration right because the lengthy delay was due to its mistaken belief that Feinberg had not signed an arbitration agreement, and could pursue her claims in court. Rather than defend against the same claims in court and in arbitration proceedings, Aegis asserts, it decided to proceed in court until Feinberg withdrew as a class representative. The record does not support this argument. Aegis provided the plaintiffs with a copy of Feinberg’s signed and initialed arbitration agreement in December 2016, more than
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P013.B04">
seven months before renewing its motion to compel arbitration. Moreover, Feinberg settled with Aegis on December 19, 2016, again, more than seven months before Aegis renewed its motion to compel arbitration, and Aegis’s renewed motion was filed nearly three months before Feinberg was removed as a class representative. In any event, a decision “to avoid severance of the arbitrable and non-arbitrable claims” by proceeding
</BLOCK>

[Page 14]
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P014.B01">
N EWIRTH V . A EGIS  S ENIOR  C OMMUNITIES
14 with litigation on all claims may be “inconsistent with the
agreement to arbitrate [the arbitrable] claims” in some
circumstances.   Van Ness , 862 F.2d at 759. 11   Accordingly,
Newirth carried her burden of showing that Aegis took
actions inconsistent with its known right to compel
arbitration.

B
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P014.B03">
Finally, we consider whether appellees were prejudiced by the inconsistent actions taken by Aegis. A party is not prejudiced by self-inflicted wounds “incurred as a direct result of suing in federal court contrary to the provisions of an arbitration agreement.” Martin , 829 F.3d at 1126; see also Fisher , 791 F.2d at 698. When a party agrees to arbitrate disputes, and then breaches that agreement by filing a lawsuit, “[a]ny extra expense incurred as a result of the [plaintiffs’] deliberate choice of an improper forum, in contravention of their contract, cannot be charged to [the defendant].” Fisher , 791
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P014.B04">
F.2d at 698. Accordingly, a plaintiff that has breached its arbitration agreement is not prejudiced by costs incurred in preparing the complaint, serving notice, and litigating non- merits issues (such as jurisdiction or venue). See id. Nor is such a plaintiff prejudiced by costs incurred due to substantial discovery in federal court, even though such discovery “would be rendered nugatory by a direction that arbitration now be had.” Britton , 916 F.2d at 1413; see also Lake Commc’ns, Inc. v. ICC Corp. , 738 F.2d 1473, 1477 (9th Cir. 1984) (holding discovery costs resulting from plaintiff’s

11  Aegis also argues that it “regularly referenced arbitration in its
filings and in its correspondence with opposing counsel, and therefore
continuously reiterated its intention to compel arbitration of this matter.” 
Aegis points to nothing in the record that supports this argument.

A breaching plaintiff may nevertheless show prejudice when the defendant has engaged in acts that are inconsistent with its right to arbitrate (as explained above), and the plaintiff has incurred costs due to such inconsistent acts. This prejudice requirement is satisfied when plaintiffs would be forced to “relitigate an issue on the merits on which they have already prevailed in court,” or when defendants have sought and “received an advantage from litigating in federal court that they would not have received in arbitration.” Martin , 829 F.3d at 1126, 1128 (prejudice found where plaintiff incurred costs “contesting the defendants’ motion

to dismiss on the merits”); see also Van Ness , 862 F.2d at 759. A plaintiff may also show it was prejudiced by expenses of litigation when it attempts to arbitrate a dispute, but is forced by the defendant to pursue its remedies in court. See Brown v. Dillard’s, Inc. , 430 F.3d 1004, 1012–13 (9th Cir. 2005). Conversely, a defendant may show prejudice due to the expenses of litigation when a plaintiff pursues its claims in state court (pursuant to an agreement with the defendant to waive its arbitration rights), and then demands arbitration of a related claim.

Aegis attempted to take advantage of the judicial forum to prevail on the merits of Newirth’s arbitrable claims, and did not file a motion to compel arbitration until after receiving an adverse ruling. If the court had granted the motion to compel arbitration, Newirth would have been forced “to relitigate a key legal issue [on the merits] on which the district court has ruled in [her] favor.” Martin , 829 F.3d at 1128. The costs of

Aegis argues that despite the fact its motion to dismiss on
the merits directly caused Newirth to incur costs contesting
that motion, Newirth was not prejudiced because Aegis does
not intend to make the same challenges in arbitration.  This
argument fails.  It ignores that Newirth already expended
costs “contesting the defendants’ motion to dismiss on the
merits,”  id.  at 1128; costs directly traceable to Aegis’s acts
inconsistent with its known right to compel arbitration.  That
Aegis intends not to revive its rejected merits arguments once
sent to arbitration does not alleviate this prejudice. Accordingly, Newirth has carried her heavy burden of
showing prejudice. AFFIRMED.
