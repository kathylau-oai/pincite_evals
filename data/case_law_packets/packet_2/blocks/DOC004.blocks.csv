5 PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND The plaintiffs filed a class action lawsuit on October 28,
2013 against the college and its owner and President, Gary
Yasuda, alleging that the defendants violated state labor laws
and the Fair Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”).  Specifically, the
plaintiffs contended, among other things, that Milan was an
“employer” within the meaning of state law as well as the
FLSA and thus, as uncompensated employees, they were
entitled to minimum hourly wages, overtime wages, and
unpaid premiums for missed meal and rest breaks.  Over
seventy individuals opted to join the action between October
2013 and March 2014."

copy of the summons and complaint via substituted service
and by mail.  They disputed the appropriateness of the service

were properly and timely served with the summons and

defendants’ counsel subsequently filed a notice of appearance
