A RMSTRONG V . M ICHAELS  S TORES , I NC . OPINION 
McKEOWN, Circuit Judge: Litigation in this case was bookended by two Supreme 
Court decisions on arbitration.  In  Epic Systems Corp. v. 
Lewis , 138 S. Ct. 1612 (2018), the Court held that arbitration 
agreements requiring individual arbitration, not class or 
collective arbitration, are enforceable, and in  Morgan v. 
Sundance, Inc. , 142 S. Ct. 1708 (2022), the Court concluded 
that the Federal Arbitration Act restricts courts from creating 
arbitration-favoring procedural rules.  These two cases 
inform our resolution of this appeal."

Likewise, a party that litigated in federal court for over a year, filed a motion to dismiss “on a key merits issue,” and received an adverse ruling before moving to compel arbitration was found to have waived the right to arbitration. Martin , 829 F.3d at 1126. Unlike either Van Ness or Martin , Michaels never wavered from the view that it had a right to arbitration,"

Finally, Michaels’s limited discovery requests did not evince a decision to take advantage of the judicial forum. The very limited requests were related at least in part to Armstrong’s non-arbitrable PAGA claim. See Fisher , 791 F.2d at 697."

there is no longer a thumb on the scale in favor of arbitration, 
and that the party opposing arbitration no longer bears a 
“heavy burden” to show waiver of the right to arbitration.  
Even in this new landscape, Armstrong has failed to 
establish that Michaels acted inconsistently with exercising 
its right to arbitrate.  We affirm the district court’s order 
compelling arbitration. AFFIRMED."
