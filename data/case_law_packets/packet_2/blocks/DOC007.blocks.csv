As a preliminary matter, Adir argues that the district court failed to adequately consider that the “heavy burden” of establishing waiver of the right to compel arbitration lies with Flores.

Furthermore, Adir “made an intentional decision to refrain from filing a motion to compel arbitration” until after this court’s reversal of the district court’s prior dismissal. Id. Adir’s year- and-a-half delay further emphasizes its “strategic decision to take advantage of the judicial forum” in a manner inconsistent with its right to arbitrate. Id.
