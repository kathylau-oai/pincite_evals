SUMMARY *
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P002.B03">
Specific Jurisdiction The panel affirmed the district court’s dismissal, due to 
lack of specific personal jurisdiction over the defendants, of 
a putative class action alleging that Shopify, Inc. violated 
various California privacy and unfair competition laws 
because it deliberately concealed its involvement in certain 
consumer transactions. Defendants offer a web-based payment processing 
platform to merchants nationwide.  When processing 
payments, defendants obtain the personal information of 
those merchants’ customers.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P002.B04">
For specific jurisdiction to exist over Shopify, plaintiff’s 
claim must arise out of or relate to Shopify’s forum-related 
activities.  The panel held that there was no causal 
relationship between Shopify’s broader business contacts in 
California and plaintiff’s claims because these contacts did 
not cause plaintiff’s harm.  Nor did plaintiff’s claims “relate 
to” Shopify’s broader business activities in California 
outside of its extraction and retention of plaintiff’s data.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P002.B05">
Because there was an insufficient relationship between 
plaintiff's claims and Shopify’s broader business contacts in 
California, the activities relevant to the specific jurisdiction 
analysis were those that caused plaintiff’s injuries: Shopify’s 
collection, retention, and use of consumer data obtained *  This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court.  It has

The panel held that Shopify, which provides nationwide web-based payment processing services to online merchants, did not expressly aim its conduct toward California. The panel held that plaintiff’s California connection—plaintiff resides in California and was physically located in California when he used Shopify’s e-commerce payment system—did not matter to the analysis of whether Shopify expressly aimed its activities toward California. When analyzing whether a court has personal jurisdiction over a web-based payment processor in a suit alleging the unlawful extraction,

retention, and sharing of consumer data, the legal framework and principles that should be brought to bear are those found in the court’s personal jurisdiction cases involving interactive websites.

OPINION BRESS, Circuit Judge: The defendants in this case offer a web-based payment processing platform to merchants nationwide. When processing payments, the defendants obtain the personal information of those merchants’ customers. In this case of first impression, we are asked to decide whether defendants’ extracting and retaining of consumer data and their tracking of customers exposes them to personal jurisdiction in California, where a consumer made his online purchase. We hold that the defendants are not subject to specific jurisdiction in California because they did not expressly aim their suit-related conduct at the forum state. When a company operates a
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P004.B03">
nationally available e-commerce payment platform and is indifferent to the location of end- users, the extraction and retention of consumer data, without more, does not subject the defendant to specific jurisdiction in the forum where the online purchase was made. We affirm the dismissal of the plaintiff’s complaint.

The plaintiff in this case is Brandon Briskin, a resident 
of California.  In June 2019, Briskin, while present in 
California, used his iPhone’s Safari browser to navigate to 
the website of California-based retailer IABMFG to 
purchase fitness apparel.  Although Briskin claims he did not

code from Shopify, Inc. to process customer orders and 
payments.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P005.B02">
Shopify, Inc. is a Canadian corporation with its 
headquarters in Ottawa, Canada.  Shopify provides 
participating merchants with a sales platform that enables the 
processing of online purchases.  As part of its business, 
Shopify obtains, processes, stores, analyzes, and shares the 
information of consumers who complete transactions on 
Shopify’s merchant-customers’ websites.  Although Briskin 
believed he was dealing only with IABMFG, in fact it was 
Shopify’s e-commerce platform that was operating behind 
the scenes to facilitate Briskin’s purchase.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P005.B03">
When completing his online order, Briskin input his 
personal identification information (name, address, etc.) and 
credit card number into IABMFG’s website.  Shopify 
collected this information.  Shopify also installed cookies 
onto Briskin’s phone, connected his browser to its network, 
generated payment forms requiring Briskin to enter private 
identifying information, and stored Briskin’s personal and 
credit card information for later use and analysis.  Shopify 
also transmitted Briskin’s payment information to a second 
payment processor, Stripe, for additional storage, analysis, 
and processing.  Shopify used the customer information it 
received to create consumer profiles, which Shopify also 
shared with its merchant and other business partners.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P005.B04">
In August 2021, Briskin filed this putative class action in 
the United States District Court for the Northern District of 
California, alleging that Shopify violated various California 
privacy and unfair competition laws because it deliberately 
concealed its involvement in the consumer transactions.  The 
complaint defined the proposed class as “[a]ll natural

submitted payment information via Shopify’s software 
while located in California.” Briskin’s complaint named as defendants Shopify, Inc. 
and two of its wholly owned subsidiaries, Shopify (USA) 
Inc. (“Shopify USA”) and Shopify Payments (USA), Inc. 
(“Shopify Payments”).  Briskin alleges that Shopify USA is 
a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business 
in Canada. 1   Shopify Payments is a Delaware corporation 
with its principal place of business in Delaware.  In this 
opinion, we use “Shopify” to refer to all three defendants, 
collectively.

<BLOCK id="DOC003.P006.B02">
In his operative complaint, Briskin provided additional allegations about Shopify’s contacts with California. Although the parties dispute the jurisdictional relevance of these contacts, Briskin alleges that Shopify not only reaches into California to extract consumers’ personal data, but also directly contracts with California merchants, including IABMFG. According to the complaint, some of the largest merchants on Shopify’s platform are California-based companies. In 2018, Shopify, Inc. opened a physical location in Los Angeles to expand its access to the California market and enhance relationships with Shopify’s over 80,000 merchant-customers in the state. Briskin further alleges that Shopify, Inc. has at least

<BLOCK id="DOC003.P006.B03">
one fulfillment center in California that stores goods from merchants and ships them to consumers, including those located in California. The complaint also alleges some jurisdictional facts specific to the two Shopify subsidiaries. Shopify USA, 1 The defendants represent that Shopify USA has its principal place of business in New York.

7 which serves as a subprocessor of user data, is registered to 
do business in California, at one point had an office in San 
Francisco, has a quarter of its employees in California, and 
provides services to thousands of California businesses.  
Shopify Payments, meanwhile, contracts with thousands of 
California merchants to enable them to accept online credit 
and debit payments.  Shopify Payments and its contractual 
partner Stripe, which has its principal place of business in 
California, then process those payments.  As part of this 
collaboration, 
Shopify 
Payments 
shares 
California 
consumers’ personal information with Stripe, which then 
uses the information to create profiles on consumers.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P007.B02">
After Briskin twice amended his complaint as part of 
bolstering his allegations about Shopify’s contacts with 
California, Shopify moved to dismiss the complaint for lack 
of personal jurisdiction.  The district court agreed, 
dismissing the second amended complaint without leave to 
amend.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P007.B03">
Briskin timely appealed.  The district court had 
jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d)(2)(A), and we have

Due process permits a court to exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant only when “the defendant has sufficient ‘minimum contacts’ with the forum state ‘such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.’” Impossible Foods , 80 F.4th at 1086 (quoting LNS Enters.

Personal jurisdiction comes in two varieties: general and specific. General jurisdiction “extends to ‘any and all claims’ brought against a defendant,” but it is appropriate only “when a defendant is ‘essentially at home’ in the State.” Ford Motor Co. , 141 S. Ct. at 1024 (quoting Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. Brown , 564 U.S. 915, 919 (2011)). A corporate defendant is considered at home in its state of incorporation and the state where it maintains its principal place of business. See Daimler AG v. Bauman , 571 U.S. 117, 137 (2014). Briskin does not argue that Shopify is

First, “the defendant must either ‘purposefully direct his activities’ toward the forum or ‘purposefully avail[] himself of the privileges of conducting activities in the forum’”; second, “the claim must be one which arises out of or relates to the defendant’s forum- related activities”; and third, “the exercise of jurisdiction must comport with fair play and substantial justice, i.e. it must be reasonable.” Axiom Foods, Inc.

The plaintiff bears the burden on the first two prongs. Ayla , 11 F.4th at 979. If they are met, then the defendant “must come forward with a ‘compelling case’ that the exercise of jurisdiction would not be reasonable.” Id. (quoting Boschetto v.

See Yahoo! , 433 F.3d at 1206. For claims that sound in tort, we “most often employ a purposeful direction analysis,” asking “whether a defendant ‘purposefully direct[s] his activities’ at the forum state . . . .” Mavrix Photo, Inc. v.

Impossible Foods , 80 F.4th at 1088–89;  Davis v. Cranfield 
Aerospace Sols., Ltd. , 71 F.4th 1154, 1162 (9th Cir. 2023), 
in this case Briskin’s claims sound classically in tort and are 
most naturally analyzed under the purposeful direction 
framework.  The parties agree on this point.  We thus 
proceed to the purposeful direction analysis.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P010.B02">
We evaluate purposeful direction under the Calder effects test, see Calder v. Jones , 465 U.S. 783 (1984), which focuses on whether the effects of the defendant’s actions were felt in the forum state. See also Walden v. Fiore , 571 U.S. 277, 286–88 (2014); Burri Law PA v. Skurla , 35 F.4th 1207, 1213 (9th Cir. 2022). Under this test, “the defendant allegedly must have (1) committed an intentional act, (2) expressly aimed at the forum state, (3) causing harm that the defendant knows is likely to be suffered in the forum state.” Mavrix Photo , 647 F.3d at

Shopify’s conduct satisfies the first  Calder  element.  We 
“construe ‘intent’ in the context of the ‘intentional act’ test 
as referring to an intent to perform an actual, physical act in 
the real world . . . .”   Schwarzenegger , 374 F.3d at 806.  Acts 
undertaken using technology can qualify as intentional acts.  
See, e.g. ,  Herbal Brands, Inc. v. Photoplaza, Inc. , 72 F.4th 
1085, 1091 (9th Cir. 2023) (noting that the defendant’s sale 
of a product via an interactive website was an intentional 
act);  Will Co. v. Lee , 47 F.4th 917, 922 (9th Cir. 2022)

11 name, and purchasing domain privacy services are 
intentional acts).  By generating payment forms, executing 
code on consumers’ devices, creating consumer profiles, 
processing consumer information, installing cookies, and 
sharing payment information, Shopify has committed 
intentional acts.  And we are willing to conclude that Briskin 
has fairly alleged the third  Calder  element as well, namely, 
that Shopify caused privacy-related harm that it knew was 
likely to be suffered in the forum state.
</BLOCK>

The issue here, and the crux of this case, lies in  Calder

To determine whether Shopify expressly aimed its activities toward California so as to purposefully direct its activities there, we must first identify which of Shopify’s California contacts are relevant to the analysis. We evaluate that issue in Section A below. In Section B, and in the absence of any controlling authority on the personal jurisdiction implications of an online payment platform, we examine our specific jurisdiction cases involving interactive websites, the most analogous precedents. From these cases, we distill key principles to govern the express aiming inquiry in a consumer data collection and retention case such as this. Finally, in

12 B RISKIN V . S HOPIFY , I NC . to support personal jurisdiction in California. The most pertinent of these are the data extraction, retention, and processing that give rise to Briskin’s claims. Setting this aspect of the case aside for the moment, Briskin also argues that Shopify does extensive business in the state. He points to Shopify’s contracts with California merchants, its Los Angeles “store” that promotes merchant relations, its California fulfillment center, the Shopify partnership with Stripe (a California company), and Shopify USA’s presence in the state (business registration, employees, etc.). Although Briskin does not argue
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P012.B02">
that these contacts are so pervasive as to create all-purpose general jurisdiction, he does suggest they are at least relevant to the specific jurisdiction analysis.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P012.B03">
That is not correct. For specific jurisdiction to exist over Shopify, Briskin’s claim “‘must be one which arises out of or relates to the defendant’s forum-related activities.’” Axiom Foods , 874 F.3d at 1068 (quoting Dole Food Co. , 303 F.3d at 1111) (emphasis added). This is a claim-tailored inquiry that requires us to examine the plaintiff’s specific injury and its connection to the forum-related activities in question. See Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Superior Ct. of Cal., S.F. Cnty. , 582 U.S. 255, 262 (2017) (explaining that “there must be ‘an affiliation between the forum and the underlying controversy’” (quoting

Goodyear , 564 U.S. at 919)); Williams v. Yamaha Motor Co. Ltd. , 851 F.3d 1015, 1022–23 (9th Cir. 2017) (“In order for a court to have specific jurisdiction over a defendant, ‘the defendant’s suit- related conduct must create a substantial connection with the forum State.’” (quoting Walden , 571 U.S. at 284)).
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P012.B05">
We think it clear that Briskin’s claims do not “arise out 
of” Shopify’s broader forum-related activities in the state (its 
contracts with California merchants, physical Shopify

13 offices, and so on).  The “arising out of” portion of the 
specific jurisdiction formula “asks about causation.”   Ford 
Motor Co. , 141 S. Ct. at 1026.  In other words, an injury 
arising “out of a defendant’s forum contacts require[s] ‘but 
for’ causation, in which ‘a direct nexus exists between a 
defendant’s contacts with the forum state and the cause of 
action.’”   Yamashita v. LG Chem, Ltd. , 62 F.4th 496, 504 
(9th Cir. 2023) (quoting  In re W. States Wholesale Nat. Gas 
Antitrust Litig. , 715 F.3d 716, 742 (9th Cir. 2013)) (brackets 
omitted).
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P013.B02">
There is no such causal relationship between Shopify’s 
broader California business contacts and Briskin’s claims 
because these contacts did not cause Briskin’s harm.  Indeed, 
Briskin himself acknowledges in his opening brief that “[t]he 
direct, unmediated interactions between Shopify and 
California shoppers through an interactive web-based 
payment platform are what form the basis for [his] claims.”  
It is readily apparent there will be causes of action that do 
arise out of Shopify’s broader business contacts with 
California (such as claims by a California merchant).  But 
Briskin’s claims are not among them.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P013.B03">
Nor do Briskin’s claims “relate to” Shopify’s broader 
business activities in California outside of its extraction and 
retention of Briskin’s data.  Focusing on the disjunctive “or” 
in the doctrinal formulation, the Supreme Court in  Ford 
clarified that “relate to” in the phase “arising out of or relate 
to” does “contemplate[] that some relationships will support 
jurisdiction without a causal showing.”  141 S. Ct. at 1026; 
see also Impossible Foods , 80 F.4th at 1093–94, 1097.  
Briskin passingly suggests that Shopify’s broader California 
contacts “relate to” his claims under  Ford , but that is wrong.  
The Supreme Court in  Ford  was clear that the “related to” 
test still “incorporates real limits, as it must to adequately

Case law demonstrates the bounded reach of the “related to” variable of the personal jurisdiction equation. In Ford , for example, the Supreme Court held that Ford in product liability cases could be subject to specific personal jurisdiction in states where it did not make, sell, or design the particular vehicle involved in an accident, but that was because Ford had “systematically served a market” in those states through comprehensive sales, marketing, and auto servicing efforts there. 141 S. Ct. at 1028–29. Similarly, in Yamashita v. LG Chem, Ltd. , 62 F.4th 496 (9th Cir. 2023), we explained that a

plaintiff could demonstrate that a claim “relates to” a defendant’s forum-related activities based on a causation-by-proxy theory. Id. at 505. Specifically, we postulated that “if similar injuries will tend to be caused by those contacts,” and “if the defendant should have foreseen the risk that its contacts might cause injuries like that of the plaintiff,” the “related to” test may be met, provided there is “a close connection between contacts and injury.” Id. at 505–06. Likewise, in Impossible Foods Inc. v. Impossible X LLC , 80 F.4th 1079 (9th Cir. 2023), we held that a declaratory judgment action for trademark

Because there is an insufficient relationship between Briskin’s claims and Shopify’s broader business contacts in California, the activities relevant to the specific jurisdiction analysis in this case are those that caused Briskin’s injuries: Shopify’s collection, retention, and use of consumer data obtained from persons who made online purchases while in California. Briskin argues that Shopify through these activities effectively “reached into” California (electronically) and inserted itself (technologically) into a transaction between a California consumer and a California merchant. The issue is whether Shopify, which provides web-based payment processing services to online merchants throughout the nation (and the world), thereby expressly

Second, and relatedly, the “‘minimum contacts’ analysis looks to the defendant’s contacts with the forum State itself, not the defendant’s contacts with persons who reside there.” Id. at 285.

Having bracketed out what our analysis  cannot  turn on, 
we now move to the principles that we think should govern 
our review.  Because Shopify operates a web-based 
platform, and for reasons we will explain below, our 
personal jurisdiction cases involving interactive websites 
provide the closest analogy to the case at hand.  The parties 
effectively agree on this point, as they have devoted the bulk 
of their briefing to these precedents.  A careful discussion of 
our circuit’s precedent in this area is therefore important to 
understanding the contours of the personal jurisdiction 
problem in this case.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P019.B04">
Almost as soon as the internet became a thing, we were 
confronted with personal jurisdiction questions involving 
internet-based businesses.  Because websites can be viewed 
from anywhere, we had to resolve whether and when web-
based operations were sufficiently “purposeful” to generate 
specific jurisdiction.  Our approach to that problem has not 
been to allow personal jurisdiction anywhere that a web 
platform can be accessed.  Instead, we have recognized that
</BLOCK>

[Page 20]
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P020.B01">
20 
B RISKIN V . S HOPIFY , I NC . there are due process constraints on the assertion of personal 
jurisdiction over non-resident defendants who operate 
through the internet.  Over the course of decades, we have 
gone about delineating and refining legal rules to govern 
when an assertion of personal jurisdiction over an out-of-
state internet platform exceeds the bounds of due process.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P020.B02">
We made clear early on that a purely “passive” website 
that merely hosts information “does not qualify as 
purposeful activity invoking the benefits and protections” of 
the fora in which the website may be viewed.   Cybersell, Inc. 
v. Cybersell, Inc. , 130 F.3d 414, 420 (9th Cir. 1997);  see also 
Herbal Brands , 72 F.4th at 1091 (“It is well settled that 
‘[m]ere passive operation of a website is insufficient to 
demonstrate express aiming.’” (quoting  Will Co. , 47 F.4th at 
922) (alteration in original)).  But an “interactive website”—
in which “users can exchange information with the host 
computer,”  Cybersell , 130 F.3d at 418—presents different 
considerations.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P020.B03">
That kind of web platform, our cases instruct, can satisfy the express aiming requirement. But not always. Driving our decision-making in this area has been the need to draw some lines to avoid subjecting web platforms to personal jurisdiction everywhere. Were it otherwise, “every time a seller offered a product for sale through an interactive website, the seller would be subjecting itself to specific jurisdiction in every forum in which the website was visible . . . .” Herbal Brands , 72 F.4th at 1091. “That result,” we have said, “would be too broad to comport with due process.” Id.

Id. at 1210. First, unlike the website in Mavrix , ePorner’s subject matter did not have a “forum- specific focus.” Id. Instead, it was a global website with 80% of its viewers located outside of the United States. Id. Second, it was individual users, not ePorner, that uploaded U.S.-generated content, so the popularity of that content was a consequence of users’ actions rather than evidence of ePorner’s intention to target the

U.S. market. Id. Although the defendants “may have foreseen that ePorner would attract a substantial number of viewers in the United States,” this was not sufficient to establish express aiming. Id. Third, the use of geo-located advertisements did not constitute express aiming when users in every forum—including forums outside of the United States—would receive ads targeted to their locations. Id. at 1211. “If such geo-located advertisements constituted express aiming,” we reasoned, “ePorner could be said to expressly aim at any forum in which a user views the website.” Id. (emphasis in original). This, too, was different than Mavrix , which

In sum, because “the United States was not ‘the focal point’ of the website ‘and of the harm suffered,’” there was no express aiming. Id. at 1212 (quoting Walden , 571 U.S. at 287).

Unlike in AMA , there were key features of ThisAV.com’s business model that evinced a forum-specific focus. Important to our analysis was that the company hosted its website on servers in Utah and purchased content delivery network services for North America, which made its website load faster in the United States than in other countries. 47 F.4th at 924–95. This helped the defendant increase its success in the U.S. market and showed that it was “motivated

In addition, we noted that the legal compliance materials on ThisAV.com’s website were “relevant almost exclusively to viewers in the United States.” Id.

Taking  Mavrix ,  AMA , and  Will Co.  together, a few 
through-lines emerge.  First, the fact that a broadly

25 is expressly aiming its intentional conduct there.   See AMA ,

</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P025.B02">
Second, to establish the “something more” needed to demonstrate express aiming in suits against internet platforms, Herbal Brands , 72 F.4th at 1092, the plaintiff must allege that the defendant platform has a “forum- specific focus.” AMA , 970 F.3d at 1210. Alternatively, the plaintiff must allege that the defendant is specifically “appeal[ing] to . . . an audience in a particular state,” Mavrix , 647 F.3d at 1231, or “actively target[ing]” the forum state, Will Co. , 47 F.4th at 923. This express aiming can be shown in different ways, such as through the subject matter of the website,
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P025.B03">
see AMA , 970 F.3d at 1210; Mavrix , 647 F.3d at 1230; the defendant’s advertising, see AMA , 970 F.3d at 1210–11; Mavrix , 647 F.3d at 1230; or other aspects of its business model, see Will Co. , 47 F.4th at 924–25. What is needed, though, is some prioritization of the forum state, some differentiation of the forum state from other locations, or some focused dedication to the forum state which permits the conclusion that the defendant’s suit-related conduct “create[s] a substantial connection” with the forum. Walden , 571 U.S. at 284. And that “substantial connection” must be

something substantial beyond the baseline connection that the defendant’s internet presence already creates with every jurisdiction through its universally accessible platform.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P025.B05">
Third, the specific nature and structure of the defendant’s 
business matters.  That is consistent with a fundamental 
precept of personal jurisdiction doctrine, which is that a 
defendant should be allowed to “‘structure its primary 
conduct’ to lessen or avoid exposure to a given State’s 
courts.”   Ford , 141 S. Ct. at 1025 (quoting  World-Wide

On this score, when considering a defendant’s business structure, the role of third parties is important. Particularly relevant to the defendant’s intent to aim activity toward the forum state and its control over that activity is the role of third parties in carrying out the defendant’s business operations, whether that be through the website content, advertising, or some other means. See AMA , 970 F.3d at 1210–11 (treating as less indicative of express aiming the fact that the website’s content was uploaded by third parties and that the defendant did not “personally control the advertisements shown on the site”). Actions
</BLOCK>

of third parties that the defendant does not control, even those of the defendant’s contractors, tend to be less reflective of the defendant’s own express aiming toward the forum because they invite a greater degree of attenuation between the plaintiff’s injuries and the defendant’s jurisdictional contacts.

We think that these precedents and principles should 
apply as well to a personal jurisdiction inquiry involving a 
broadly accessible back-end web platform like Shopify that 
processes consumer payments.  We say so for several 
reasons. The first is that Shopify’s web platform, which secures 
consumer information, is not so different from the other

<BLOCK id="DOC003.P027.B01">
B RISKIN V . S HOPIFY , I NC . 27 interactive websites we have previously considered. In Mavrix , for example, the defendant celebrity gossip website had various interactive features that involved the acquisition of viewer information, such as consumer polls and requests to subscribe to email newsletters and membership clubs. See 647 F.3d at 1222. And in AMA , the defendant evidently received information about end-user location so that it could deploy “geo-located advertisements, which tailor advertisements based on the perceived location of the viewer.” 970 F.3d at 1211; see also id. at 1220 n.2 (Gould, J., dissenting)

(explaining that ePorner is “more than a purely passive website because it has interactive features,” including consumers agreeing to terms and conditions of use).
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P027.B03">
To the extent Briskin argues that an online payment 
platform’s extraction of consumer data reflects more 
“active” engagement with the forum state than the conduct 
at issue in our past interactive website cases, we do not think 
those differences call for application of a fundamentally 
different legal framework than the one set forth in  Mavrix , 
AMA , and  Will Co.   If forum-specific differences do exist in 
a given case between an internet platform that obtains 
purchaser information and one that obtains other user 
information (such as their email addresses), those 
differences can be accounted for when applying the 
principles we have laid out above.  They do not require a 
completely different set of legal rules.

See Herbal Brands , 72 F.4th at 1091;  CollegeSource , 653 
F.3d at 1075–76;  Cybersell , 130 F.3d at 420.  Although there 
are some differences between an interactive web platform 
that predominantly offers content and one that processes 
consumer transactions, the nationwide availability of these 
platforms provides a common denominator that raises 
consonant due process concerns.

Briskin protests that, by this logic, Shopify will be able to direct its activities to all fifty states and yet be free from specific jurisdiction in each of them. That is not quite right considering that Shopify will be subject to personal jurisdiction in other fora, such as the jurisdictions where the Shopify defendants are either incorporated or based. And that is to say nothing of suits that plaintiffs could likely bring against California merchants in California, who could in turn seek relief against Shopify, as appropriate. But the broader point is that Briskin’s objection would apply just as well

to the activities of any web-based business that operates nationwide. Although Briskin’s objection is not without force, our law has long recognized that as a matter of due process, web-based platforms cannot be subject to specific jurisdiction in any forum from which they are accessible, which would lead to “the eventual demise of all restrictions” on personal jurisdiction. CollegeSource , 653 F.3d at 1076 (quoting World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. , 444 U.S. at 294).

We also reject Briskin’s assertion that we should analyze 
this case as if it involved the sale of physical goods through 
an interactive website.  In  Herbal Brands, Inc. v. Photoplaza, 
Inc. , 72 F.4th 1085 (9th Cir. 2023), we held that “if a 
defendant, in its regular course of business, sells a physical 
product via an interactive website and causes that product to 
be delivered to the forum, the defendant has purposefully

Herbal Brands was a suit brought in Arizona against New York defendants who had made allegedly unauthorized sales of the plaintiff’s products in Arizona using Amazon’s online storefront platform. Id. at 1088–89. We held the defendants were subject to personal jurisdiction in Arizona because “they created and maintained a distribution network that reached the relevant forum by choosing to operate on a universally accessible website that accepts orders from residents of all fifty states and delivers products to all fifty states.” Id. at 1094–95. We further made clear that in the case of the online sale of physical goods, “the
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P029.B03">
express aiming inquiry does not require a showing that the defendant targeted its advertising or operations at the forum,” although the defendant still did have to “exercise some level of control over the ultimate distribution of its products beyond simply placing its products into the stream of commerce.” Id. at 1094.

Herbal Brands  does not govern the personal jurisdiction 
inquiry here.   Herbal Brands  was clear that its “holding 
answers only the narrow question whether a defendant’s sale 
of a physical product to a consumer in the forum state via an 
interactive website constitutes conduct expressly aimed at a 
forum.”   Id.  at 1095.  We specifically indicated in  Herbal 
Brands  that “[i]f  other internet activity  is allegedly the 
source of personal jurisdiction, cases such as  Mavrix ,  AMA , 
and  Will Co.  would continue to apply.”   Id.  (emphasis 
added).   Herbal Brands  thus directed application of the very 
precedents we have held should apply here. That guidance makes sense considering the logic of 
Herbal Brands  itself.   Herbal Brands  specifically

In Herbal Brands , we explained that a different set of legal rules should apply in the case of the online sale of physical items because “[p]re-internet, the ‘distribution in the forum state of goods originating elsewhere’ was a paradigmatic example of conduct purposefully directed at the forum state.” Id. at 1093 (quoting Schwarzenegger , 374 F.3d at 803). The Supreme Court’s decision in Keeton v. Hustler Magazine, Inc. , 465 U.S. 770 (1984),
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P030.B02">
on which Briskin relies, is similarly distinguishable because it too involved the distribution of products into the forum state. Under Herbal Brands , the sale of physical items through the internet is simply different from other forms of internet activity, based on long-held understandings about the jurisdictional significance of physical shipments into a forum. That traditional legal backdrop, however, does not extend to the extraction of consumer data through an online transaction involving a back-end payment processor.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P030.B03">
We thus hold that when analyzing whether a court has 
personal jurisdiction over a web-based payment processor in 
a suit alleging the unlawful extraction, retention, and sharing 
of consumer data, the legal framework and principles that 
should be brought to bear are those from  Mavrix ,  AMA , and

We now apply those principles to this case and hold that 
Shopify has not expressly aimed its suit-related conduct

Shopify’s platform is accessible across the United States, and the platform is indifferent to the location of either the merchant or the end consumer. No one has alleged that Shopify alters its data collection activities based on the location of a given online purchaser. It did not prioritize consumers in California or specifically cultivate them. Briskin would have suffered the same

injury regardless of whether IABMFG was a California company and regardless of whether Briskin was physically located in California when he made his purchase. As Briskin acknowledged in his opening brief, Shopify “chose to extract personal data from IABMFG’s customer’s— wherever located —through the payment portal it created and maintained.” (Emphasis added).

Shopify, to be sure, no doubt benefits from consumers who are present in California. But that California is a large market does not answer the purposeful direction question because a defendant foreseeably profiting from persons making online purchases in California does not demonstrate express aiming. See Walden , 571 U.S. at 289 (“Petitioner’s actions in Georgia did not create sufficient contacts with Nevada simply because he allegedly directed his conduct at plaintiffs whom he knew had Nevada connections.”); AMA , 970 F.3d at 1210 (“Although [the defendants] may have foreseen that ePorner would attract a substantial number of viewers in
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P031.B04">
the United States, this alone does not support a finding of express aiming.”). And while Shopify does have a sizeable merchant base in California, its extraction and retention of consumer data depends on the actions of third- party merchants who are engaged in independent transactions that themselves do not depend on consumers

(“ePorner’s content is primarily uploaded by its users, and

Briskin offers some inventive hypotheticals in response, 
but they are off target.  Briskin asserts that what Shopify did 
here was no different than physically placing a surveillance 
device at a cash register in a California store and using it to 
intercept customers’ payment details.  He also analogizes 
Shopify to a hypothetical food truck with a surveillance 
device that operates in both California and Nevada but is 
agnostic as to which state the truck is located.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P032.B03">
These hypotheticals fail to grasp the significance of Shopify operating a broadly accessible web-based platform. The nature of such an operation leads to due process concerns when the implication of Briskin’s position is that Shopify is subject to specific jurisdiction in every state. Contrary to Walden ’s clear command, Briskin would effectively tie personal jurisdiction to the unilateral activity of consumers or Shopify’s contacts with individual persons. See Walden , 571 U.S. at 284. And unlike Briskin’s hypotheticals, Shopify, by the allegations of the complaint, did not place any kind of physical device in California. Cf. Herbal Brands , 72

F.4th at 1093. It did not focus its efforts on any particular location. And it did not interact with consumers except as a result of the third-party decisions of its merchants. Briskin’s hypotheticals involve a degree of express aiming that is simply not present on the facts alleged.

In holding that Shopify is not subject to specific

structure of a defendant’s business can affect the personal 
jurisdiction analysis.  In view of the “fact-intensive nature” 
of the personal jurisdiction inquiry,  Herbal Brands , 72 F.4th 
at 1096, we have set forth the governing legal principles and 
applied them to the facts alleged.  But we do not purport to 
decide how these principles may apply to online payment 
platforms that are set up differently.

As a fallback, Briskin argues that if we conclude 
personal jurisdiction is lacking, we should remand to allow 
him the opportunity to take jurisdictional discovery of 
Shopify.  We review the denial of jurisdictional discovery 
for abuse of discretion.   Yamashita , 62 F.4th at 507.  We will 
not reverse a district court’s refusal to allow jurisdictional 
discovery “except upon the clearest showing that denial of 
discovery results in actual and substantial prejudice to the 
complaining litigant.”   Id.  (quoting  Boschetto , 539 F.3d at 
1020).
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC003.P033.B04">
These demanding standards are not met here.  In the 
court below, Briskin requested leave to take jurisdictional 
discovery in only two curt footnotes in his opposition briefs 
to Shopify’s motions to dismiss.  Briskin provided no 
supporting argument in favor of this desired discovery.  Nor 
has Briskin explained what jurisdictional discovery would 
accomplish or how it would change the result of this case.  
See Yamashita , 22 F.4th at 507 (“[A] mere hunch that 
discovery might yield jurisdictionally relevant facts, or bare 
allegations in the face of specific denials, are insufficient 
reasons for a court to grant jurisdictional discovery.” 
(quoting  LNS Enters. , 22 F.4th at 864–65)).  The problems

B RISKIN V . S HOPIFY , I NC . the nature of his claims and Shopify’s business structure.  
Although the district court did not explicitly address 
Briskin’s request for discovery, the district court’s effective 
denial of this request was not an abuse of discretion.

Because we conclude that Shopify is not subject to 
specific jurisdiction, we need not address the district court’s 
additional determination that the complaint failed to comply 
with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 by insufficiently 
detailing how each Shopify defendant had wronged Briskin. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.
