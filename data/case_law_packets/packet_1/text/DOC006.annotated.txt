SUMMARY *
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC006.P002.B03">
Personal Jurisdiction The panel affirmed the district court’s dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction of a copyright infringement, trademark infringement, and unfair competition action. Defendant, a citizen and resident of Poland, operated ePorner, an adult video website, through MW Media, a Polish civil law partnership. Plaintiff contended that defendant was subject to specific personal jurisdiction in the United States because he expressly aimed tortious conduct at the forum. Applying Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(k)(2), known as the “federal long-arm statute,” the panel held that the exercise of personal jurisdiction would not comport with due process because defendant lacked the

requisite minimum contacts with the United States. The panel concluded that defendant committed intentional acts by establishing and maintaining ePorner, registering two domains, and entering into an agreement with an American domain name server, but he did not expressly aim his suit- related conduct at the United States. The panel also held that the district court did not abuse its discretion by limiting the scope of plaintiff’s jurisdictional discovery on the basis of privacy concerns.

OPINION
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC006.P004.B03">
R. NELSON, Circuit Judge: AMA Multimedia, LLC (“AMA”) appeals the district 
court’s dismissal of its copyright infringement, trademark 
infringement, and unfair competition action against Marcin 
Wanat for lack of personal jurisdiction.  We agree with the 
district court that AMA has not met its burden of showing 
that Wanat is subject to personal jurisdiction in the United 
States.  We also conclude that the district court did not abuse 
its discretion by denying AMA certain jurisdictional 
discovery and decline to consider arguments about changes 
in European law for the first time on appeal that bear on 
AMA’s entitlement to additional jurisdictional discovery.  
We therefore affirm.

AMA discovered that ePorner.com (“ePorner”)—an

contracts with a third-party advertising company that 
chooses the advertisements.  The advertiser then 
“geolocates” the advertisements, meaning visitors to 
ePorner.com see advertisements based on their perceived 
location.  For example, visitors thought to be in the United 
States see selected advertisements in English, while visitors 
thought to be in France see selected advertisements in 
French.

AMA was unable to determine who owned and operated ePorner, so, in 2015, AMA sued all defendants as Doe Defendants and Roe Corporations in the United States. The district court permitted AMA to conduct early discovery to ascertain who owned the domains epornergay.com and eprncdn.com, both of which forwarded visitors to ePorner.com. That early discovery revealed that two companies located in Arizona, GoDaddy.com and Domains by Proxy, were used to register the domains and privatize the owner’s identity. AMA subpoenaed both companies and learned that Defendant Marcin Wanat was the registrant of the domains. AMA amended its complaint and named

Wanat registered epornergay.com and eprncdn.com, he did 
not register the ePorner.com domain. Through his operation of ePorner, Wanat maintains 
limited contacts with the United States.  Wanat registered the 
domain names through GoDaddy.com, an American 
company, but did so from Poland using a Polish version of 
GoDaddy’s website.  Wanat also entered into an agreement 
with an American domain name server (“DNS”), Tiggee 
LLC (doing business as DNSMadeEasy.com) (“Tiggee”), 
that allows users to access ePorner more efficiently by 
translating its domain names into Internet Protocol 
addresses.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC006.P006.B02">
However, Wanat has never visited the United States, has 
never paid taxes in the United States, does not have a visa to 
travel to the United States, and has never “derived any profit 
from any of [his] activities in the [United] States as [he] 
conduct[s] no such activities.”  Nor do Wanat, MW Media, 
or ePorner maintain any offices or agents in the United 
States.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC006.P006.B03">
At the time this suit was filed, the adult content available 
on ePorner was stored on a server in the Netherlands.  Wanat 
stated he does not “specifically target any of [his] services to 
residents of the [United] States.”  19.21% of ePorner’s 
visitors are in the United States, making the United States its 
largest market.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC006.P006.B04">
AMA asserted federal claims for copyright infringement, 
trademark infringement, and unfair competition.  Wanat 
moved to dismiss based on a lack of personal jurisdiction.  
After a hearing, the district court ordered jurisdictional 
discovery.
</BLOCK>

AMA M ULTIMEDIA V . W ANAT
7 AMA sought documents related to epornergay.com and 
eprncdn.com, including contracts and correspondence 
between the websites and U.S. companies.  Wanat objected 
to several of AMA’s discovery requests, primarily arguing 
that producing certain personal data as part of the requested 
discovery would expose him to criminal liability under 
Poland’s Personal Data Protection Act of 29 August 1997 
(“PDP”).  AMA argued that exceptions to the PDP allowed 
Wanat to produce the data and that, even if the exceptions 
did not apply, Wanat could redact such personal information.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC006.P007.B02">
The district court appointed a Special Master agreed upon by the parties and familiar with U.S. and Polish law to resolve the discovery disputes. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 53. AMA and Wanat hired their own Polish lawyers to evaluate Wanat’s discovery objections. In June 2016, AMA filed a Motion to Compel and Wanat filed a Motion for Protective Order. In an exhibit to his Motion for Protective Order, Wanat raised the fact that changes to the European privacy laws were under consideration. Specifically, his Polish law expert noted that work on a “Privacy Shield” that could replace the PDP’s
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC006.P007.B03">
“Safe Harbor” provision was in progress and could affect the transfer of personal data from European countries to the United States. AMA did not address this potential change in the law in its briefing.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC006.P007.B04">
On July 12, six days after the parties completed their 
briefing to the Special Master, the European Commission 
issued its Implementing Decision (EU) 2016/1250 2  (the 
“Privacy Shield Decision”), which, among other things, 
established that Member States (including Poland) could 
transfer personal data to certain organizations in the United 2  Available at https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF

States that committed to a set of privacy principles and self-
certified their adherence to these principles to the 
Department of Commerce.   See id.  §§ 2, 2.1.  Neither party 
raised this change in law with the Special Master, and AMA 
did not argue that it was a self-certified organization or 
provide any evidence to that effect.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC006.P008.B02">
On August 22, the Special Master submitted its 52-page 
Report and Recommendation to the district court.  Most of 
the discovery disputes addressed by the Special Master did 
not involve the application of the PDP.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC006.P008.B03">
The Special Master recommended some of AMA’s discovery requests involving personal information be denied because responding to the requests would require Wanat to produce “personal data,” potentially exposing him to criminal liability under the PDP. The Special Master explained that personal data could not be transferred to the United States because: (1) the PDP’s “Safe Harbor” provision, which allows the transfer of such data to certain countries that provide “adequate level[s] of personal data protection,” did not apply to the United States, and (2) none of the PDP’s other exceptions permitting such transfer applied. As to the first point, relying

on the Court of Justice of the European Union’s decision in Case C-362/14, Schrems v. Data Prot. Comm’r , 2015 E.C.R. 650, the Special Master determined that “the U.S. has been deemed a Third Country that does not ensure a level of protection that meets European standards.” AMA thereafter submitted its Objections to Special Master’s Report and Recommendation, but did not raise the Privacy Shield Decision in its briefing. The Special Master’s Report and Recommendation did not address the recent implementation of the Privacy Shield Decision. Adopting the recommendations of the Special Master in full, the

district court sustained Wanat’s objections to AMA’s 
discovery requests.  AMA moved for reconsideration, but 
again did not raise the Privacy Shield Decision.  The district 
court denied the motion.  Wanat then renewed his motion to 
dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.  The district court 
granted the motion to dismiss, holding that because AMA 
could not establish sufficient minimum contacts between 
Wanat and the United States, asserting specific jurisdiction 
over Wanat would be unreasonable.  AMA timely appealed, 
challenging both the jurisdictional and discovery orders.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC006.P009.B02">
After two extensions, AMA filed its opening brief on June 18, 2018. But twenty-four days earlier, the European Parliament repealed and replaced the PDP with the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) (2016/679) (“GDPR”), 3 which also addressed the transfer of personal data outside of EU Member States, although not specifically focused on transfers to the United States. Neither party mentioned the Privacy Shield Decision or the GDPR in their briefs. Following oral argument, we withdrew submission of the appeal and directed the parties to file supplemental briefs on several issues, including the effect of the Privacy Shield Decision on this

Personal jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant is 
proper where permitted by a long-arm statute and where the 
exercise of jurisdiction does not violate federal due process.  
Pebble Beach Co. v. Caddy , 453 F.3d 1151, 1154 (9th Cir. 
2006).  Here, AMA asserts that Federal Rule of Civil 
Procedure 4(k)(2), known as the “federal long-arm statute,” 
id.  at 1159, permits the exercise of personal jurisdiction over 
Wanat.  Rule 4(k)(2) contains three requirements:
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC006.P011.B04">
First, the claim against the defendant must 
arise under federal law. Second, the 
defendant must not be subject to the personal 
jurisdiction of any state court of general 
jurisdiction. Third, the federal court’s 
exercise of personal jurisdiction must 
comport with due process.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC006.P011.B05">
Id.  (internal citation omitted).  Because there is no dispute 
the first two requirements are satisfied, we address only 
whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction over Wanat 
comports with due process.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC006.P011.B06">
Due process requires that a defendant who is not present 
in the forum has “certain minimum contacts” with the forum 
“such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend 
traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.”   Int’l 
Shoe Co. v. Washington , 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945) (internal

<BLOCK id="DOC006.P012.B02">
Turning to the due process analysis, we conduct a three-
part inquiry to determine whether a nonresident defendant 
has such “minimum contacts” with the forum to warrant the 
court’s exercise of specific jurisdiction:
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC006.P012.B03">
(1) the defendant must either “purposefully direct his activities” toward the forum or “purposefully avail[] himself of the privileges of conducting activities in the forum”; (2) “the claim must be one which arises out of or relates to the defendant’s forum- related activities”; and (3) “the exercise of jurisdiction must comport with fair play and substantial justice, i.e. it must be reasonable.” Axiom Foods, Inc. v. Acerchem Int’l, Inc ., 874 F.3d 1064,1068 (9th Cir. 2017) (quoting Dole Food Co. v. Watts , 303 F.3d 1104, 1111 (9th Cir. 2002)). “If any of the three requirements is not satisfied, jurisdiction

</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC006.P012.B05">

depends on the nature of the claim at issue.”   Picot v. Weston , 
780 F.3d 1206, 1212 (9th Cir. 2015).  AMA alleges 
copyright and trademark infringement claims, which sound 
in tort, so we apply a “purposeful direction” analysis and ask 
whether Wanat has purposefully directed activities at the 
United States. 4 See Axiom , 874 F.3d at 1069;  Mavrix , 
647 F.3d at 1228.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC006.P013.B02">
Where allegedly tortious conduct takes place outside the forum and has effects inside the forum, our circuit has examined purposeful direction using an “effects test” based on Calder v. Jones , 465 U.S. 783 (1984). See Mavrix , 647 F.3d at 1228–29 (applying the “effects test” in a copyright infringement case); Panavision Int’l, L.P. v. Toeppen , 141 F.3d 1316, 1321–22 (9th Cir. 1998) (applying the Calder test in a trademark dilution case).

We first conclude that Wanat committed an intentional 
act.  For purposes of jurisdiction, a defendant acts 
intentionally when he acts with “an intent to perform an 
actual, physical act in the real world, rather than an intent to 
accomplish a result or consequence of that act.” 4  If the exercise of jurisdiction over these claims were proper, we 
may assert “pendent personal jurisdiction” over AMA’s additional claim 
for unfair competition because it arises out of a common nucleus of 
operative fact.   See Action Embroidery Corp. v. Atl. Embroidery, Inc. ,

on the website’s subject matter, as well as the

Here, AMA argues Wanat expressly aimed ePorner at 
the U.S. market, as evidenced by: (1) Wanat’s use of geo-
targeted advertisements and the purported corresponding 
U.S. revenue, (2) ePorner’s U.S. viewer-base, which 
comprises 19.21% of the site’s total visitors, (3) ePorner’s 
Terms of Service (“TOS”), referred to as a “contractual 
agreement,” and (4) the use of the U.S.-based Tiggee.  We 
hold that AMA has failed to meet its burden of 
demonstrating that Wanat expressly aimed his intentional 
acts at the United States.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC006.P016.B04">
Although similar in some respects, this case materially 
differs from  Mavrix  in several important respects.  First, 
Brand’s website had “a specific focus on the California-
centered celebrity and entertainment industries.”   Mavrix , 
647 F.3d at 1230.  “ Based on the website’s subject matter
. . . we conclude[d] that Brand anticipated, desired, and 
achieved a substantial California viewer base.”   Id.
(emphasis added).  By contrast, ePorner lacks a forum-

AMA M ULTIMEDIA V . W ANAT
17 
specific focus.  As the district court noted, “the market for 
adult content is global,” evidenced by the fact that the other 
80% of ePorner’s viewers were outside the United States.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC006.P017.B02">
Second, although, according to AMA, ePorner “features a significant portion of U.S.-based content from producers like AMA and U.S.-based models,” this does not mean ePorner’s subject matter is aimed at the U.S. market to the same degree Brand’s website was aimed at California. ePorner’s content is primarily uploaded by its users, and the popularity or volume of U.S.-generated adult content does not show that Wanat expressly aimed the site at the U.S. market. See Walden , 571 U.S. at 284 (“[T]he relationship must arise out of contacts that the defendant himself creates with the forum State.”) (emphasis in original) (internal

<BLOCK id="DOC006.P017.B03">
quotation marks omitted). Instead, it merely suggests the United States produces a significant quantity of adult content or that ePorner’s users are more likely to upload content produced in the United States. Although Wanat may have foreseen that ePorner would attract a substantial number of viewers in the United States, this alone does not support a finding of express aiming. See id. at 289 (rejecting our conclusion that a defendant’s knowledge of a plaintiff’s strong forum connections plus foreseeable harm in the forum comprises sufficient minimum contacts); see also Axiom , 874 F.3d at 1069–70; Pebble Beach , 453 F.3d

at 1158 (rejecting an argument for express aiming that “relie[d] almost exclusively on the possible foreseeable effects”).
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC006.P017.B05">
Third, ePorner’s forum-based website traffic does not 
have the same relevance here as it did in  Mavrix  because of 
the differences in the websites’ advertising structures.  In 
Mavrix , the “substantial number of hits” to Brand’s site from 
Californians was relevant because advertisements on 
Brand’s site targeted California residents, meaning website

Brand’s knowledge of this user base meant that it “anticipated, desired, and achieved a substantial California viewer base.” Id. We found it immaterial whether Brand or the third-party advertisers targeted Californians because the targeting itself indicated that Brand knew about the California user base which it then exploited “for commercial gain by selling space on its website for advertisements.” 6 Id. “This audience [was] an integral component of Brand’s business model and its profitability.” Id.

<BLOCK id="DOC006.P018.B03">
Here, nearly 20% of ePorner’s traffic comes from U.S. users. But this does not establish that Wanat expressly aimed at the U.S. market, because ePorner’s advertising structure materially differs from Brand’s. AMA alleges, and Wanat’s expert agreed, that ePorner uses geo-located advertisements, which tailor advertisements based on the perceived location of the viewer. This tailoring does not establish that Wanat expressly aimed ePorner at the United States. ePorner’s geo-located advertisements, provided by a third-party advertising company, unlike Brand’s, are always directed at the forum: a viewer in the United States will see advertisements tailored to the United States while a

<BLOCK id="DOC006.P018.B04">
viewer in Germany will see advertisements tailored to Germany. Wanat does not personally control the advertisements shown on the site, as ePorner contracts with third parties (not 6 To the extent the Mavrix court found the website’s traffic relevant to targeting, Walden made clear that the third-party advertiser’s behavior cannot be attributed to the defendant as a contact.

themselves or sell the space to other parties who do.  
ePorner’s forum-based traffic, absent other indicia of 
Wanat’s personal direction, does not establish that Wanat 
tailored the website to attract U.S. traffic.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC006.P019.B02">
If such geo-located advertisements constituted express aiming, ePorner could be said to expressly aim at any forum in which a user views the website. As we recognized in Mavrix , “[n]ot all material placed on the Internet is, solely by virtue of its universal accessibility, expressly aimed at every [forum] in which it is accessed.” 647 F.3d at 1231. As a feature of the geo-located advertisements on ePorner’s website, all users in every forum received advertisements directed at them. To find specific jurisdiction based on this would run afoul of the Supreme Court’s directive in Walden and “impermissibly allow[] a

</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC006.P019.B04">
Wanat’s other contacts with the United States also fail to establish express aiming. AMA argues that ePorner’s TOS suggest that ePorner (and presumably Wanat) entered into contracts with many U.S. residents because anyone who 7 In Mavrix , we stated that where “a website with national viewership and scope appeals to, and profits from, an audience in a particular state, the site’s operators can be said to have ‘expressly aimed’ at that state.” 647 F.3d at 1231. Here, the same concept applies to whether ePorner, a website with an international audience, is appealing to, and profiting from, users in the
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC006.P019.B05">
United States. We find, however, ePorner does not “ appeal [] to ” the United States such that it could be said to have “expressly aimed” at the forum. True, ePorner “profits from” the United States. But the profit results from ePorner’s users who access the site rather than from Wanat’s targeting of forum users who access the site. This differs from Brand’s website which targeted California users through the website’s content.

joined the site assented to the TOS, thereby forming a 
contract.  Whether or not the TOS constitutes a contract, it 
does not evince Wanat’s or ePorner’s effort to target the U.S. 
market.  Any dispute with U.S. residents arising out of the 
performance of the TOS could create specific jurisdiction in 
the United States for violation of those terms.  But AMA 
does not allege violations of the TOS.  The TOS therefore 
does not establish any targeting of the U.S. market; it at most 
suggests Wanat knew ePorner might have U.S. traffic.   See 
Axiom , 874 F.3d at 1069–70.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC006.P020.B02">
Finally, the use of Tiggee to register certain domain names related to the website does not show targeting of the U.S. market. AMA contends that the use of Tiggee, which advertises itself as one of the fastest DNS providers in the United States, evidences targeting of the United States because of the speed such companies provide to U.S. website visitors. Use of a company that offers fast speeds in the United States could be consistent with the desire to appeal to the U.S. market. But AMA has not provided evidence to suggest that Wanat chose this vendor or was motivated

9 Because we hold that AMA has failed to meet its burden on the first prong of the minimum contacts test regarding purposeful direction, we do not need to reach the second and third prongs. However, we would conclude that AMA also fails to satisfy the second and third prongs of the minimum contacts test. Specifically, AMA has failed to show that its claims arise out of or relate to Wanat’s forum-related activities and that the balance of factors supports the conclusion that exercising jurisdiction over Wanat would be unreasonable. First, nothing more than AMA’s contested bare allegations support any

personal involvement by Wanat in uploading, encouraging the uploading, or intentionally failing to remove the infringing content. Second, on balance, exercising jurisdiction over Wanat, a Polish citizen, would be unreasonable given his limited contacts with the forum, the burden on Wanat if he must defend in the forum, potential conflicts with Poland’s sovereignty and its potential as an alternative forum. See Core-Vent Corp. v. Nobel Indus. AB , 11 F.3d 1482, 1487–88 (9th Cir. 1993), modified , Yahoo! Inc. v. La Ligue Contre Le Racisme Et L’Antisemitisme , 433 F.3d 1199 (9th Cir. 2006). While AMA has an interest in

539 F.3d at 1020.  We conclude it did not.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC006.P022.B02">
First, we consider de novo whether the district court 
made any legal error.  The district court denied certain 
jurisdictional discovery to AMA because, according to the 
Special Master’s Report and Recommendation which was 
adopted in full, the PDP and the Court of Justice’s  Schrems
decision barred Wanat from producing “personal data” to the 
United States because such disclosure might subject Wanat 
to criminal liability under Polish law.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC006.P022.B03">
AMA never made the Special Master or the district court aware of the Privacy Shield Decision, and therefore the district court did not err in failing to consider it. The district court had no duty to identify sua sponte a change in law, particularly when—given the record before the district court—the legal change did not give AMA the right to obtain jurisdictional discovery. See United States v. Sineneng- Smith , 140 S. Ct. 1575, 1579 (2020) (“[W]e rely on the parties to frame the issues for decision and assign to courts the role of neutral arbiter of matters the parties

The parties jointly recommended the Special Master, hired their own Polish law experts, and briefed the jurisdictional discovery issues before the Special Master issued its Report and Recommendation. Notably, in an exhibit filed with the Special Master, Wanat’s expert stated that changes to the European privacy laws were under consideration that could replace the PDP’s “Safe Harbor” provision and affect the transfer of personal data to the United States. AMA, however, did not address these 10 On appeal, AMA only contests the district court’s discovery rulings to the

The Privacy Shield Decision was implemented after the parties completed their briefing to the Special Master and before the Special Master’s Report and Recommendation. But AMA never raised this change in law to the Special Master, to the district court, in its motion for reconsideration, or in opposition to Wanat’s renewed motion to dismiss. Again, Wanat’s expert had provided notice that a change in the European privacy laws was under consideration at the time the parties were briefing the issue to the district court and AMA had both notice and opportunity to raise this issue before the case was dismissed.

Second, the proper vehicle for raising this issue would have been through a supplemental notice to the Special Master or the district court, or even in a motion for reconsideration before final judgment, not by raising it for the first time on appeal. See D. Ariz. R. LRCiv 7.2(g)(1) (Motions for Reconsideration) (2015) (motions for reconsideration should show “manifest error or a showing of new facts or legal authority that could not have been brought to [the court’s] attention earlier with reasonable diligence”); see also Rentrop v.

Third, no exceptional circumstances warrant application

discovery depends on whether AMA is a self-certified 
organization under the Privacy Shield Decision, which is 
plainly a factual question.  For the same reason, resolving 
this issue in AMA’s favor would prejudice Wanat because 
AMA is asking for remand to develop the factual record as 
to whether AMA satisfied the Privacy Shield Decision’s 
self-certification requirements.   See Raich , 500 F.3d at 868.

R. NELSON, concurring: I write separately to address potential issues left open in light of our decision to affirm the district court’s order dismissing the complaint. While the presumption may be that our decision fully resolves this case, perhaps the door remains slightly open for further proceedings on remand. See Hampton v. Pac. Inv. Mgmt. Co. , 869 F.3d 844, 846 (9th Cir. 2017) (“Dismissals for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction . . . must be without prejudice, because a lack of jurisdiction deprives the dismissing court of any power to adjudicate the merits of the case.”) (citation omitted). We hold

that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied certain jurisdictional discovery to AMA. We also decline to exercise our discretion to review AMA’s new legal claims, raised for the first time on appeal, regarding the impact of intervening foreign law on its jurisdictional discovery requests.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC006.P029.B04">
I do not understand our opinion, however, to preclude the 
district court from exercising its discretion on remand to 
consider intervening law in any supplemental request for 
jurisdictional discovery or amendment of AMA’s complaint.

Privacy Shield Decision and GDPR—may have opened the

AMA M ULTIMEDIA V . W ANAT On remand, the district court may wish to allow AMA to 
amend its complaint or request additional briefing to 
consider whether the Privacy Shield Decision and GDPR 
have altered the analysis on available jurisdictional 
discovery. 1   To be sure, the current record is silent whether 
AMA could benefit through self-certification under the 
Privacy Shield Decision or the GDPR.  And AMA has 
provided no evidence on appeal that it has self-certified.  
However, these are issues that the district court may wish to 
evaluate on remand.

<BLOCK id="DOC006.P030.B02">
If additional jurisdictional discovery is ordered, Wanat’s contacts with the United States may be shown to be more significant than the current record demonstrates. For example, ePorner refused to produce any of its advertising agreements. Wanat’s expert stated he could not conclusively determine that ePorner only used “ad networks rather than more directly negotiating with advertisers in addition to the ad network.” Evidence that Wanat negotiated with advertisers directly may reveal whether he intended to target U.S. users. Similarly, evidence that Wanat engaged Tiggee for the purpose of targeting U.S. forum residents may affect the analysis as well. The extent

<BLOCK id="DOC006.P030.B03">
of these contacts could also affect the reasonableness analysis. If the district court does decide that additional jurisdictional analysis is warranted on remand, one additional issue—and potentially a threshold one for 1 Assuming AMA followed the self-certification procedures, I would be concerned with an interpretation of either the Privacy Shield Decision or the GDPR that would wholly prevent Wanat from producing jurisdictionally relevant “personal data.” Significant safeguards are available for producing even the most sensitive and confidential data. Moreover, Wanat’s counsel at oral argument agreed Wanat would comply with a discovery order, notwithstanding the GDPR.

jurisdictional discovery—may be considered.  AMA argues 
that MW Media’s and Madon’s U.S. contacts may be 
imputed to Wanat because MW Media is a civil law 
partnership between Wanat and Madon, which, under Polish 
law, has no legal personality and cannot be sued.  Therefore, 
AMA claims that because Wanat is jointly liable for the 
debts and obligations of the partnership, any contact by the 
partnership may be attributed to Wanat for jurisdictional 
purposes.  This could become an important issue impacting 
what jurisdictional discovery is relevant and what contacts 
may support the court’s jurisdiction over Wanat.

<BLOCK id="DOC006.P031.B02">
We previously considered whether a partnership’s 
contacts could be imputed to a partner for jurisdictional 
purposes in  Sher v. Johnson , 911 F.2d 1357, 1365 (9th Cir. 
1990), and held that a Florida law firm’s contacts with 
California could not be attributed to its individual partners.  
Like AMA’s argument here, “[t]he Shers contend[ed], 
without benefit of case support, that because the liability of 
the partnership would establish the joint and several liability 
of each individual partner, . . . jurisdiction over the 
partnership establishes jurisdiction over the partners.”   Id.

did not, however, foreclose the possibility that a forum’s

Because the majority summarizes most of the key facts, 
I reiterate only those most relevant to the personal 
jurisdiction analysis.  First, Defendant Marcin Wanat is a 
Polish citizen and partner in MW Media, S.C., which owns 
and operates the adult video website ePorner.com.  
Allegedly, ePorner.com has infringed copyrighted materials 
of Plaintiff AMA Multimedia, which is a Nevada limited 
liability company.  After being sued by AMA in the District 
of Arizona, Wanat filed a motion to dismiss for lack of 
personal jurisdiction.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC006.P034.B04">
Although no facts in the current record show that Wanat directly conducts activity within the United States, it is undisputed that ePorner.com’s most important commercial market is the United States: 19.21% of its website traffic comes from the United States, while Germany makes up the second largest market, comprising 13.67% of the website traffic. No other country accounts for more than 6% of the traffic to the site. In turn, ePorner.com’s business model turns solely on advertising profits, and it uses third parties to geolocate advertisements based on a visitor’s perceived location. Because of the higher premiums placed on U.S.-
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC006.P034.B05">
focused advertising, the U.S. market likely makes up an even greater proportion of ePorner.com’s profits than its user base would suggest.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC006.P034.B06">
While ePorner.com now stores its videos on a server in 
the Netherlands, before this suit it principally used the 
domain name servers of U.S.-based Tiggee LLC, which 
claims to provide the fastest internet speeds in the eastern 
United States and second fastest in the western United 
States. Also, ePorner.com’s Terms of Service as of 2015 
stated that the website content was “owned by and/or

The majority correctly identifies the “effects test” derived from Calder v. Jones , 465 U.S. 783 (1984) as the appropriate standard by which to gauge whether Wanat purposefully directed his activities toward the United States. Under the effects test, “the defendant allegedly must have (1) committed an intentional act, (2) expressly aimed at the forum state, (3) causing harm that the defendant knows is likely to be suffered in the forum state.” Mavrix Photo, Inc. v.

A defendant who operates a passive website “expressly aims” at a forum if he engages in “conduct directly targeting the forum.” Mavrix , 647 F.3d at 1229. 2 We have held that this requirement was satisfied when a defendant “continuously and deliberately exploited” the forum’s market for commercial gain, by operating “a website whose economic value turns, in significant measure, on its appeal to [forum residents].” Id. at 1230; accord Keeton v. Hustler Mag., Inc. , 465 U.S. 770, 781 (1984) (“Where, as in this case, [the defendant] has continuously and deliberately exploited the New Hampshire market [by selling magazines],

</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC006.P037.B05">
Here, there should be little question that these conditions are satisfied. As in Mavrix , ePorner.com’s business model depends on “selling advertising space on its website to third- party advertisers: the more visitors there are to the site, the more hits that are made on the advertisements; the more hits that are made on the advertisements, the more money that is paid by the advertisers to [ePorner.com and Wanat].” Id. ePorner.com’s ads are geolocated to the perceived location 2 It is worth noting that ePorner.com is more than a purely passive website because it has interactive features that “that involve

of its visitors, and at nearly 20% of the website’s traffic, the 
United States audience is “substantial” and in fact makes up 
a larger proportion of ePorner’s user base than any other 
country, by a significant margin.

“[I]mmaterial [of] whether the third-party advertisers or [ePorner and Wanat] targeted [United States] residents,” “[t]he fact that the advertisements targeted [U.S.] residents indicates that [ePorner] knows—either actually or constructively—about its [U.S.] user base, and that it exploits that base for commercial gain by selling space on its website for advertisements.” Id. ; see also Kurbanov , 963 F.3d at 348, 353–54 (in finding jurisdiction, reasoning that “[w]hile [the defendant] outsourced the role of finding advertisers for the Websites to brokers, the fact remains that he earns revenues precisely because the advertising is targeted to visitors in [the forum]” through “geolocation”

or “geo-targeting”). This is especially true where, as here, ePorner has contracted with a U.S.-based DNS company that specifically markets itself as providing fast internet speeds in the United States. 3 The straightforward conclusion is that the United States “audience is an integral component of [ePorner’s] business model and its profitability,” and that “it does not violate due process to hold [ePorner or Wanat] answerable in a [U.S.] court for the contents of a website whose economic value turns, in significant measure, on its appeal to [U.S. residents].” Mavrix , 647 F.3d at 1230.

Among other things, the majority suggests that personal jurisdiction is improper because Wanat and ePorner lacked a “forum-specific focus,” noting that “the market for adult content is global.” See Maj. Op. at 16–17. But it is well- established that no forum-specific requirement exists. In Keeton , the Supreme Court held that New Hampshire had personal jurisdiction over a national magazine even though the magazine distributed fewer copies in that state than others and even though “the bulk of the harm done to [the plaintiff] occurred outside New Hampshire.” 465 U.S. at 780. Because the magazine “continuously and deliberately exploited the

Inc. v. La Ligue Contre Le Racisme Et L’Antisemitisme , 433 F.3d 1199, 1207 (9th Cir. 2006) (en banc) (per curiam); see also Mavrix , 647 F.3d at 1230–31 (finding jurisdiction in California despite the

Here, the market for adult content is not uniquely and exclusively American, but Wanat should nonetheless be held accountable in a United States court because he has “continuously and deliberately exploited” the U.S. market.

Rather, in Mavrix , “[t]he record [did] not reflect how many of the website’s visitors are California residents.” 647 F.3d at 1222. In light of that absence, we focused on the subject matter of the website (celebrity gossip) as evidence that the website had significant appeal in the California forum. Id. at 1230. We then considered that subject matter along with “the size and commercial value of

Unlike Mavrix , we need not rely on the subject matter of ePorner.com as evidence from which to infer the site’s appeal in the forum: The record directly shows that ePorner.com appeals to a significant U.S. audience and that it contracts with a U.S.-based DNS company which markets itself as providing faster internet speeds to U.S. users. To hold that there is no express aiming here is

41 The majority apparently grounds its reluctance to make 
this plain inference, in part, on  Walden v. Fiore , 571 U.S. 
277 (2014), by reasoning that foreseeability of harm to the 
plaintiff in the forum cannot alone establish minimum 
contacts and that only the defendant’s own contacts with the 
forum can provide the basis for jurisdiction.   See Maj. Op. 
at 17–19 & n.6.  These propositions are undeniably true.  
They are also beside the point.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC006.P041.B02">
First, foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff principally 
relates not to the express aiming analysis, but to the third 
prong of the effects test—whether the defendant “caus[ed] 
harm that the defendant knows is likely to be suffered in the 
forum.”   Mavrix , 647 F.3d at 1228.  Although individualized 
targeting “will not, on its own, support the exercise of 
specific jurisdiction” after  Walden , it is still “relevant to the 
minimum contacts inquiry.”   Axiom , 874 F.3d at 1070.  
Indeed, that is the only way that the second and third prongs 
of the effects test do not entirely collapse into each other.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC006.P041.B03">
Second, Walden stands for the proposition that a defendant may not simply rely on a plaintiff’s contacts with the defendant and the forum to establish personal jurisdiction. Walden , 571 U.S. at 289. That principle of due process, however, does not make a defendant immune from suit when the “‘effects’ of the alleged [tortious conduct] connect[] the defendant[] to [the forum], not just to the plaintiff.” Id. at 287. The majority elides this important distinction, asserting that, “[t]o find specific jurisdiction based on [users in the forum receiving targeted advertisements] would run afoul of the Supreme Court’s directive in Walden

contacts with  users  in the forum have nothing to do with the 
plaintiff.  And as I have explained, the facts here show that 
Wanat “knows—either actually or constructively—about 
[ePorner.com’s U.S.] user base, and that [he] exploits that 
base for commercial gain by selling space on [the] website 
for advertisements.”   Mavrix , 674 F.3d at 1230.

Taking AMA’s uncontroverted allegations as true and 
resolving factual disputes in its favor, there is more than 
enough here to conclude that Wanat, through ePorner, 
expressly aimed his conduct at the United States.  The 
second prong of the effects test should have been resolved in 
AMA’s favor.

The third prong of the effects test is also clearly satisfied. Because ePorner allegedly violated the intellectual property rights of AMA, which is headquartered in the United States, and because the harm involves the potential diversion of U.S. users and revenues from AMA’s own platforms, Wanat’s express aiming is “causing harm that [he] knows is likely to be suffered in the forum.” See Brayton Purcell , 606 F.3d at 1131 (it is foreseeable that a plaintiff will be “harmed by infringement of its copyright[s and trademarks], including harm to its business reputation and goodwill, and decreased business and profits”); Mavrix

Having established purposeful direction, the next step in the minimum contacts inquiry is to consider whether the claim “arises out of or relates to the defendant’s forum- related activities.” Axiom , 874 F.3d at 1068 (quoting Dole Food , 303 F.3d at 1111)). This step, too, straightforwardly supports jurisdiction. Wanat operates ePorner.com. That website allegedly displayed infringing videos, causing harm to AMA in the United States. But for Wanat’s operation of ePorner.com, AMA would not have been harmed in the forum. The harm to AMA arises out of Wanat’s U.S. contacts. Cf. Mavrix , 647 F.3d at 1228 (“[The plaintiff’s]

5  Because the majority dismisses the case at the purposeful direction 
step, it only briefly addresses, in one sentence in a footnote, whether the 
claim arises out of or relates to the defendant’s forum-related activities 
and concludes that it does not.   See Maj. Op.  at 21 n.9. Its only stated 
reason is that “nothing more than AMA’s contested bare allegations 
support any personal involvement by Wanat in uploading, encouraging 
the uploading, or intentionally failing to remove the infringing content.”  
Id.   But it is not contested that Wanat, through his partnership MW 
Media, assists in operating ePorner.com.  The majority’s cursory, non-
binding dicta cannot withstand scrutiny.
