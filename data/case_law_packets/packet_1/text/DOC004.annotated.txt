SUMMARY *
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC004.P002.B03">
Personal Jurisdiction Reversing the district court’s dismissal for lack of 
personal jurisdiction over defendants in an action under the 
Lanham Act, the panel held that, if a defendant, in its regular 
course of business, sells a physical product via an interactive 
website and causes that product to be delivered to the forum, 
then the defendant has purposefully directed its conduct at 
the forum such that the exercise of personal jurisdiction may 
be appropriate.

<BLOCK id="DOC004.P002.B04">
Herbal Brands, Inc., which has its principal place of 
business in Arizona, brought suit in Arizona against New 
York 
residents 
that 
sell 
products 
via 
Amazon 
storefronts.  Herbal Brands alleged that defendants’ 
unauthorized sale of Herbal Brands products on Amazon, to 
Arizona residents and others, violated the Lanham Act and 
state law.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC004.P002.B05">
The panel applied the Arizona long-arm statute, which 
provides for personal jurisdiction co-extensive with the 
limits of federal due process.  Due process requires that a 
nonresident defendant must have “certain minimum 
contacts” with the forum such that the exercise of personal 
jurisdiction does not offend traditional notions of fair play 
and substantial justice. Addressing the first prong of the specific jurisdiction 
inquiry, the panel applied a purposeful direction analysis, *  This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court.  It has

The panel held that Herbal Brands met its initial burden of showing that defendants purposefully directed their activities at the forum because, under the Calder effects test, defendants’ sale of products to Arizona residents was an intentional act, and Herbal Brands’ cease- and-desist letters informed defendants that their actions were causing harm in Arizona. In addition, defendants “expressly aimed” their
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC004.P003.B02">
conduct at the forum because an interactive website plus “something more” constitutes “express aiming.” Defendants’ Amazon storefronts were interactive websites, and defendants’ sales of products to Arizona residents were the requisite “something more” because the sales occurred as part of defendants’ regular course of business, and defendants exercised some level of control over the ultimate distribution of their products beyond simply placing their products into the stream of commerce. Recognizing a range of approaches adopted by other circuits in response to similar questions, the panel stated that it did not attempt to reconcile the split among the circuits.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC004.P003.B03">
Addressing the second prong of the specific jurisdiction 
inquiry, the panel held that Herbal Brands’ harm arose out 
of defendants’ contacts with Arizona.  Addressing the third 
prong, the panel held that defendants failed to show that the 
exercise of jurisdiction would not be reasonable.  Thus, in 
sum, defendants had sufficient minimum contacts with 
Arizona, Herbal Brands’ harm arose out of those contacts, 
and the exercise of personal jurisdiction would be reasonable 
in the circumstances.

OPINION 
GRABER, Circuit Judge: Internet commerce is ubiquitous in the modern economy, 
allowing sellers to reach potential consumers around the 
globe.  Yet we have not addressed directly the question 
presented by this appeal:  Does the sale of a product via an 
interactive website provide sufficient “minimum contacts” 
to support personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant 
in the state where the defendant causes the product to be 
delivered, when the plaintiff in that state brings a claim for 
an intentional tort related to the sale of the product?

has purposefully directed its conduct at the forum such that the exercise of personal jurisdiction may be appropriate. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY Plaintiff Herbal Brands is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Arizona.

Arizona residents “through the regular course of business,” 
but, without access to Defendants’ sales data, Plaintiff is 
unable to allege the exact number of sales made to Arizona 
customers.

Plaintiff 
sent 
three 
cease-and-desist

to 
Defendants, asserting that Defendants were infringing 
Plaintiff’s trademarks and tortiously interfering with 
Plaintiff’s agreements with its Authorized Sellers.  The 
letters informed Defendants that Plaintiff was based in 
Arizona and alleged that those sales harmed Plaintiff in 
Arizona.  Despite Plaintiff’s letters, Defendants’ Amazon 
storefronts remained operational.

<BLOCK id="DOC004.P006.B03">
Plaintiff filed this action in federal district court in 
Arizona, bringing claims for (1) trademark infringement and

law; (2) false advertising under the Lanham Act; and (3) 
tortious 
interference 
with

opposition to the motion, Plaintiff submitted an additional 
declaration attesting that, as of July 2021, Defendants had 
sold more than 25,700 allegedly infringing products and that

customers in Arizona from purchasing those products. The district court granted the motion to dismiss for lack 
of personal jurisdiction, holding that Plaintiff failed to meet

Plaintiff alleges that Defendants, in their regular course

those allegations are sufficient to support the exercise of 
specific personal jurisdiction in this instance.

Line Inc. v. Wärtsilä N. Am., Inc., 485 F.3d 450, 460 (9th Cir. 2007) (emphasis added). Here, Plaintiff brings claims for trademark infringement, false advertising, and tortious interference with business relationships. Because each of those claims requires an intentional tortious or

</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC004.P010.B03">
To determine whether a defendant “purposefully directed” its activities toward the forum, we apply, in turn, the “effects” test derived from Calder v. Jones, 465 U.S. 783 (1984). That test “focuses on the forum in which the defendant’s actions were felt, whether or not the actions themselves occurred within the forum.” Mavrix, 647 F.3d at 1228 (quoting Yahoo! Inc. v. La Ligue Contre Le Racisme Et L’Antisemitisme, 433 F.3d 1199, 1206 (9th Cir. 2006) (en banc) (per curiam)) (internal quotation mark omitted). The Calder effects test asks “whether the defendant: ‘(1) committed an intentional act, (2) expressly aimed at the

Plaintiff easily satisfies the first and third elements of the 
Calder effects test.  Defendants’ sale of products to Arizona

Watts, 303 F.3d 1104, 1113 (9th Cir. 2002) (recognizing that a corporation can suffer economic harm in many fora, including where the corporation has its principal place of business). The closer question is whether Defendants “expressly aimed” their conduct at the forum. 1. An Interactive Website Plus “Something More” Constitutes “Express Aiming.” We begin by considering Defendants’ internet-based activity. More than two decades ago, we recognized a distinction between “passive” websites that merely make

<BLOCK id="DOC004.P011.B02">
information available to visitors and “interactive” websites, where “users can exchange information with the host computer when the site is interactive.” Cybersell, Inc. v. Cybersell, Inc., 130 F.3d 414, 418 (9th Cir. 1997). It is well settled that “[m]ere passive operation of a website is insufficient to demonstrate express aiming.” Will Co., 47 F.4th at 922; see Mavrix, 647 F.3d at 1231 (“Not all material placed on the Internet is, solely by virtue of its universal accessibility, expressly aimed at every state in which it is accessed.”). Similarly, operation of an interactive website does not, by itself, establish express aiming.

Otherwise, every time a 2 The cease-and-desist letters are relevant to our analysis due to the specific facts and claims at issue in this case. Because Plaintiff’s claims are based on trademark infringement, without the letters Defendants might not have known that Plaintiff would be harmed in Arizona. By contrast, if a plaintiff were to allege that he was poisoned by a product, then the shipment of that product to the plaintiff’s forum would suffice to show that the defendant knew that the harm “is likely to be suffered in the forum state.” Will Co., 47 F.4th at 922 (citation

That result would be too broad to comport with due process. See CollegeSource, Inc. v. AcademyOne, Inc., 653 F.3d 1066, 1075–76 (9th Cir. 2011) (“If the maintenance of an interactive website were sufficient to support general jurisdiction in every forum in which users interacted with the

</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC004.P012.B03">
But operating a website “in conjunction with ‘something more’—conduct directly targeting the forum—is sufficient” to satisfy the express aiming prong. Mavrix, 647 F.3d at 1229 (quoting Rio Props., Inc. v. Rio Int’l Interlink, 284 F.3d 1007, 1020 (9th Cir. 2002)). The interactivity of the website is one of several factors that can be relevant to the question whether a defendant has done “something more.” 3 Id. In some cases, the operators of a website “can be said to have ‘expressly aimed’ at a forum where a website ‘with national viewership and scope appeals to, and profits from, an audience in

a particular state.’” AMA Multimedia, LLC v. Wanat, 970 F.3d 1201, 1210 (9th Cir. 2020) (quoting Mavrix, 647 F.3d at 1231). When the website itself is the only jurisdictional contact, our analysis turns on whether the site had a forum-specific focus or the defendant exhibited an intent to cultivate an audience in the forum. See, e.g., 3 We have acknowledged that there is a “sliding scale” of how interactive a website is, and a higher degree of interactivity provides greater support for the exercise of specific jurisdiction. See Mavrix, 647 F.3d at 1226– 27.

Here, it is undisputed that Defendants’ Amazon storefronts are interactive websites: visitors can exchange information with the host computer by inputting data directly. But that fact alone does not establish “express aiming,” and Plaintiff does not allege that Defendants specifically directed their website (or their products) at Arizona. Instead, Plaintiff argues that jurisdiction exists because Defendants actually sold infringing products via an interactive website and caused them to be delivered to forum residents. 4 4 The fact that Defendants used Amazon storefronts instead of proprietary websites does not change our analysis in this instance. As a participant in the “Fulfillment

Defendants retain ownership of the goods and can choose to end their relationship with Amazon at any time. Although Defendants are removed from the process of handling orders, the use of Amazon’s fulfillment service to handle shipping logistics does not alter our jurisdictional analysis any more than a seller’s use of the post office to ship its products would affect the inquiry. See Boschetto v. Hansing, 539 F.3d 1011, 1018–19 (9th Cir. 2008) (discussing how the

Defendants’ Sales of Products to Arizona Residents are the Requisite “Something More.” We have not squarely addressed the question whether sales of a product to forum residents through an interactive website constitute “something more” to establish express aiming when there is no evidence that the seller specifically targeted that forum. We now hold that if a defendant, in its regular course of business, sells a physical product via an interactive website and causes that product to be delivered to the forum, the

5  We are careful to emphasize that our jurisdictional inquiry is concerned 
with the actions of the defendant.  Walden, 571 U.S. at 289.  The conduct 
purposefully directed at the forum is the seller’s action of accepting the 
order and causing the product to be delivered to the forum.  In this case, 
the allegations do not suggest that Arizona residents purchased products 
to be shipped to other states.  But if an Arizona resident ordered a product 
for delivery to a friend in California, a seller’s fulfillment of that 
hypothetical order in the regular course of its business would be conduct 
purposefully directed at California (the location of the delivery), not 
Arizona (the residence of the purchaser).

complex, for jurisdictional purposes, the act of selling 
physical products over the internet to a forum resident is 
substantially the same as selling those same products to a 
forum resident through a mail-order catalog.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC004.P016.B02">
Thus, we conclude that the sales of physical products into a forum via an interactive website can be sufficient to establish that a defendant expressly aimed its conduct at the forum, provided that two key elements are present. First, the sales must occur as part of the defendant’s regular course of business instead of being “random, isolated, or fortuitous.” Keeton, 465 U.S. at 774; see Boschetto, 539 F.3d at 1017, 1019 (holding that “the lone transaction for the sale of one item” did not create personal jurisdiction over the defendants in California because there were no allegations that the seller

was a regular user of eBay to sell cars or “as a broader vehicle for commercial activity”). 6 When an online sale occurs as part of a defendant’s regular course of business, it “arises from the efforts of the [seller] to serve directly or indirectly[] the market for its product . . . ,” and the defendant “should reasonably anticipate being haled into 6 Although Boschetto is not binding because we conducted that analysis under the “purposeful availment” framework, its rationale is still instructive. Because our court’s distinction between “purposeful direction” and “purposeful availment” is quite narrow, similar principles underlie

both tests. See, e.g., Holland Am. Line, 485 F.3d at 459–60 (concluding that the plaintiff failed to satisfy the purposeful availment test and relying, in part, on Panavision Int’l, L.P. v. Toeppen, 141 F.3d 1316, 1322 (9th Cir. 1998), and Pebble Beach Co. v. Caddy, 453 F.3d 1151, 1158 (9th Cir. 2006), both of which employed the purposeful direction test); cf. Davis v. Cranfield Aerospace Sols., Ltd., No. 22- 35099, slip op. at 8–9 (9th Cir. June 23, 2023) (suggesting that a rigid dividing line between the two inquiries does not serve the purposes of due process).

Whether a sale occurs in a defendant’s regular course of business is a case-specific question that may turn on factors such as the seller’s identity (individual or a business entity), the nature of the website used, the defendant’s total volume of online sales including sales outside the forum, the number or variety of products offered on the defendant’s website, and the defendant’s online advertising. Because Defendants do not contend

that the alleged sales to Arizona residents occurred outside of their regular course of business, we leave the precise contours of that inquiry for another day.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC004.P017.B03">
Second, the defendant must exercise some level of control over the ultimate distribution of its products beyond simply placing its products into the stream of commerce. See Ayla, 11 F.4th at 981–82 (concluding that the defendant’s offering of products for sale through its website and third-party websites was evidence that the defendant’s contacts with the forum were not “random, isolated, or fortuitous”); Holland Am. Line, 485 F.3d at 459 (“The placement of a product into the stream of commerce, without more, is not an act purposefully directed toward a forum state.”). Although other factors may be relevant in certain circumstances,
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC004.P017.B04">
the express aiming inquiry does not require a showing that the defendant targeted its advertising or operations at the forum.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC004.P017.B05">
Plaintiff’s allegations meet this standard.  First, 
Defendants allegedly used their Amazon storefronts—their 
means of conducting regular business—to make product 
sales to Arizona residents.  Plaintiffs specifically allege that 
Defendants operated their storefronts under the names of 
business entities, offered a variety of Herbal Brands products 
on their storefronts, and conducted a high volume of sales

18 H ERBAL B RANDS , I NC . V . P HOTOPLAZA , I NC . throughout the country. Second, Defendants exercised control over distribution: they created and maintained a distribution network that reached the relevant forum by choosing to operate on a universally accessible website that accepts orders from residents of all fifty states and delivers products to all fifty states. See NBA Props., Inc. v. HANWJH, 46 F.4th 614, 625 (7th Cir. 2022) (reasoning that, when a defendant “structured its sales activity in such a manner as to invite orders from [a forum] and developed the capacity

<BLOCK id="DOC004.P018.B02">
to fill them[,] [i]t cannot now point to its customers in [that forum] and tell us, ‘It was all their idea.’” (citation and some quotation marks omitted)), cert. denied, 143 S. Ct. 577 (2023). Accordingly, we hold that Defendants expressly aimed their conduct at Arizona because they allegedly sold products to Arizona residents via an interactive website in their regular course of business and caused those products to be delivered to the forum.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC004.P018.B03">
The outcome of the express-aiming inquiry does not depend on the number of sales made to customers in the forum. Drawing a line based on the number of sales would require an arbitrary distinction that is not preferred in this area of the law. See Burger King, 471 U.S. at 485–86 (emphasizing that, in determining whether to exercise personal jurisdiction, courts must weigh the facts of each case instead of relying on “talismanic jurisdictional formulas”). If one sale were not enough to establish that a defendant expressly aimed its conduct at a forum, we would face the difficult question of
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC004.P018.B04">
how many sales would suffice. The same challenges would exist if we were to attempt to craft a rule based on sales to the forum as a percentage of a defendant’s total sales. Instead of taking on an arbitrary line-drawing task, we require only that the sale must occur in the defendant’s

H ERBAL B RANDS , I NC . V . P HOTOPLAZA , I NC . 19 regular course of business. Consistent with Keeton, our holding distinguishes between a truly isolated sale and a genuine attempt to serve the market. See Ayla, 11 F.4th at 981 (“As Keeton demonstrates, there is no ‘small percentage of sales’ exception to the purposeful direction principles discussed herein.”); Plant Food Co-Op, 633 F.2d at 159 (distinguishing between a product sale that is “an isolated occurrence” and a sale that “arises from the efforts of the distributor to serve, directly or indirectly, the market for

<BLOCK id="DOC004.P019.B02">
its products in other states”). Any concerns that this rule will have negative effects on small online sellers are best addressed as part of the third prong of the specific jurisdiction inquiry; the exercise of jurisdiction always “must be reasonable.” Schwarzenegger, 374 F.3d at 802.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC004.P019.B03">
To reiterate, our holding answers only the narrow 
question whether a defendant’s sale of a physical product to 
a consumer in the forum state via an interactive website 
constitutes conduct expressly aimed at a forum.  If other 
internet activity is allegedly the source of personal 
jurisdiction, cases such as Mavrix, AMA, and Will Co. 
would continue to apply.  We also need not and do not 
answer the question whether the outcome would be different 
if a defendant did not sell directly to consumers but instead 
sold its products to a third party with no knowledge of that 
third party’s intent to sell into a particular forum.  Cf. 
Yamashita, 62 F.4th at 504.

<BLOCK id="DOC004.P019.B04">
We recognize that other circuits have adopted a range of 
approaches in response to similar questions.  See, e.g., Chloe 
v. Queen Bee of Beverly Hills, LLC, 616 F.3d 158, 165, 
171–72 (2d Cir. 2010) (holding that a defendant’s conduct

Zazzle, Inc., 42 F.4th 948, 953–55 (8th Cir. 2022) (holding that the defendant’s sale of a single t-shirt to a Missouri resident did not create sufficient contacts to support the exercise of jurisdiction); Admar Int’l, Inc. v.

</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC004.P020.B03">
Given the fact-intensive nature of the inquiry and the 
wide range of potential analytical approaches, we do not 
attempt to reconcile the split among the circuits.  We look 
only at the facts before us and put forward the test that makes 
the most sense in this particular context.  The ubiquity of 
internet commerce creates a myriad of jurisdictional 
questions.  We answer only the one question before us and 
leave the remainder for another day. B. Plaintiff’s Harm Arises Out of Defendants’ Contacts With the Forum State.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC004.P020.B04">
The second prong of the specific jurisdiction inquiry 
requires that a plaintiff’s claims “‘arise out of or relate to the 
defendant’s contacts’ with the forum.”  Ford Motor Co. v. 
Mont. Eighth Jud. Dist. Ct., 141 S. Ct. 1017, 1025 (2021) 
(quoting Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Superior Ct., 582 U.S. 
255, 262 (2017)).  “The first half of that standard asks about 
causation; but the back half, after the ‘or,’ contemplates that 
some relationships will support jurisdiction without a causal 
showing.”  Id. at 1026.  Plaintiff’s claims—which allege

out of and relate to Defendants’ conduct of selling those 
same products to Arizona residents.  See Ayla, 11 F. 4th at 
983 (holding that the defendant’s promotion, sale, and 
distribution of products in the forum relate to the plaintiff’s 
trademark claims). C. The Exercise of Jurisdiction Over Defendants Would Be Reasonable.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC004.P021.B02">
Once Plaintiff satisfies the first two prongs, “the burden 
then shifts to the defendant to ‘present a compelling case’ 
that the exercise of jurisdiction would not be reasonable.”  
Schwarzenegger, 374 F.3d at 802 (quoting Burger King, 471 
U.S. at 476–78).  To evaluate reasonableness, we employ a 
balancing test that weighs seven factors:
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC004.P021.B03">
(1) the extent of the defendant’s purposeful 
interjection into the forum state’s affairs; (2) 
the burden on the defendant of defending in 
the forum; (3) the extent of conflict with the 
sovereignty of the defendant’s state; (4) the 
forum state’s interest in adjudicating the 
dispute; (5) the most efficient judicial 
resolution of the controversy; (6) the 
importance of the forum to the plaintiff’s 
interest in convenient and effective relief; 
and (7) the existence of an alternative forum.

exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable, but they fail 
to address any of those factors.

H ERBAL  B RANDS , I NC .  V . P HOTOPLAZA , I NC . That said, we do acknowledge that Defendants’ larger 
concerns—the 
ability 
of 
plaintiffs 
to 
manufacture 
jurisdiction and the potential for negative effects on e-
commerce—are legitimate.  Although Defendants fail to 
meet their burden here, a defendant in a future case could 
argue that the exercise of personal jurisdiction would be 
unreasonable, even if that defendant has “expressly aimed” 
its conduct at the forum consistent with the test that we adopt 
in this opinion.  Many of the concerns that courts have 
considered as part of the “express aiming” analysis are, in 
our view, better addressed under the reasonableness prong.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC004.P022.B02">
For instance, we recognize that a plaintiff’s contacts alone should not be enough to create jurisdiction over a defendant in a forum. See Axiom Foods, 874 F.3d at 1070 (“[W]e must look to the defendant’s ‘own contacts’ with the forum, not to the defendant’s knowledge of a plaintiff’s connections to a forum.” (quoting Walden, 571 U.S. at 289)). Other circuits have reached different conclusions regarding whether sales to a plaintiff or its agents can be a source of jurisdiction. Compare NBA Props., 46 F.4th at 625, 627 (holding that a single sale to an agent of the plaintiff can create
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC004.P022.B03">
personal jurisdiction), with Toys “R” Us, Inc. v. Step Two, S.A., 318 F.3d 446, 454–55 (3d Cir. 2003) (holding that two sales initiated by the plaintiff cannot establish personal jurisdiction). Depending on the particular facts of a future case, jurisdiction might not exist if a plaintiff purchased a product solely in an attempt to manufacture jurisdiction. But the identity of the purchaser is not relevant to whether the defendant expressly aimed its conduct at the forum. And, in any event, Defendants do not make that argument here. The fairness prong also allows for the argument that the exercise of jurisdiction
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC004.P022.B04">
is not appropriate because a

23 defendant sold only a small number of products to forum 
residents.  If, for example, a Maine resident ran a small 
business selling New England-themed keychains and made 
a sale to an Arizona resident, the seller may be able to argue 
successfully that it would not be reasonable to hale him into 
court in Arizona because of the limited nature of his 
purposeful interjection into Arizona’s affairs or the 
excessive burden associated with defending himself in the 
forum.  See Freestream Aircraft, 905 F.3d at 607–08.  But 
those hypothetical facts are not the facts of this case and, 
once again, Defendants do not advance that argument here.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC004.P023.B02">
In sum, we hold that the district court has personal 
jurisdiction 
over 
Defendants. 
Taking 
Plaintiff’s 
uncontroverted allegations as true, Defendants’ sales of 
products via an interactive website occurred in their regular 
course of business, Defendants caused those products to be 
shipped to the forum, and Defendants were aware that harm 
was occurring in the forum.  Defendants have not met their 
burden of showing that the exercise of personal jurisdiction 
would be unreasonable.  Thus, we conclude that Defendants 
have sufficient minimum contacts with Arizona, Plaintiff’s 
harm arises out of those contacts, and the exercise of 
personal 
jurisdiction 
would 
be 
reasonable 
in 
the 
circumstances. REVERSED AND REMANDED.
