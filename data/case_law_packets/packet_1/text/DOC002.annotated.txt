SUMMARY *
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC002.P002.B03">
Personal Jurisdiction The en banc court reversed the district court’s dismissal 
for lack of personal jurisdiction, and applying traditional 
specific personal jurisdiction precedent to e-commerce, 
concluded that jurisdiction was proper because Defendants’ 
allegedly tortious actions deliberately targeted Plaintiff 
Brandon Briskin in California.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC002.P002.B04">
Briskin, a California resident, used his iPhone’s Safari browser to purchase clothing from the brand IABMFG at https://www.iambecoming.com. When he pressed the “Pay now” button, he had no way of knowing that by doing so he submitted his personal data not to IABMFG, but to Shopify, an e-commerce platform that facilitates online sales for merchants with whom it contracts. Briskin filed his putative class action alleging privacy-related torts in the Northern District of California against Shopify, Inc., a Canadian corporation, and two of its wholly-owned United States subsidiaries, Shopify (USA), Inc., and Shopify Payments (USA), Inc., Delaware corporations. * This

B RISKIN V . S HOPIFY , I NC . 
3 The en banc court concluded that Shopify is subject to 
specific personal jurisdiction in California because 
Shopify’s allegedly tortious actions deliberately targeted 
Briskin in California where: (1) Shopify conceded that its 
geolocation technology allowed it to know that Briskin’s 
device was located in California when it installed cookies on 
Briskin’s device; and (2) Briskin’s complaint alleged that 
Shopify used the data gathered by its cookies to compile 
consumer profiles and then sold them without the 
consumer’s knowledge or consent.  The en banc court 
overruled precedent requiring defendants’ conduct to evince 
“differential targeting” of a specific forum to establish 
specific personal jurisdiction in that forum.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC002.P003.B02">
The en banc court also held that the district court erred 
in dismissing Briskin’s complaint on vagueness grounds.  
Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2) requires a short and plain statement 
of the claim in order to give the defendant fair notice of what 
the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.  The en banc 
court held that complaint satisfied Rule 8(a)(2) because it 
provided sufficient information to give the Shopify entities 
fair notice of the claims against them.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC002.P003.B03">
Concurring in the judgment, Judge Collins agreed that 
the district court erred in dismissing this action for lack of 
jurisdiction over the Shopify defendants, but his reasoning 
differed in some respects from that of the majority.  To 
establish personal jurisdiction over Defendants in California, 
Briskin must show that each Defendant’s suit-related 
conduct created a substantial connection with California, 
which entails a showing that Briskin’s claims arose out of or 
related to some action by which a given Defendant 
purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting 
activities within the forum State.  In his view, this standard 
is readily satisfied here, because each Defendant allegedly
</BLOCK>

[Page 4]
<BLOCK id="DOC002.P004.B01">
4 
B RISKIN V . S HOPIFY , I NC . committed, or is responsible for, tortious conduct within 
California.  He also agreed with the majority that Briskin’s 
pleading was sufficient to avoid dismissal on the ground that 
it was an impermissible group-pleading.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC002.P004.B02">
Concurring, Judge Bumatay would hold that in 
determining personal jurisdiction over out-of-state corporate 
defendants, the analysis must focus on an analogy to 
physical presence, and it does not matter whether the 
defendant also targeted the forum State over other States.  
Given the allegations made against the Shopify entities, the 
Shopify entities were sufficiently present in California to not 
require any targeting of the State to assert personal 
jurisdiction over them.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC002.P004.B03">
Dissenting, Judge Callahan would hold that Supreme 
Court precedent precludes the majority’s expansive view of 
specific personal jurisdiction in this case.  In her view, 
Shopify’s allegedly tortious conduct was not expressly 
aimed at California.

WARDLAW, Circuit Judge: Since 1994, when the first shoppers in the United States 
turned to the “World Wide Web” to search for and make 
purchases online, what is now known as “e-commerce” has 
grown exponentially.  Just last year, on Cyber Monday, U.S. 
consumers spent over thirteen billion dollars in online 
purchases on a single day, and U.S. online purchases were 
expected to exceed forty billion dollars through Cyber 
Week. 1   And as e-commerce has proliferated, it has also 
evolved to incorporate new technology, devices, and

Shopify is an e-commerce platform that facilitates online sales for merchants with whom it contracts. Merchants pay to access Shopify’s software and infrastructure, which the merchants use to design, set up, and manage their own online stores. The merchants use Shopify’s website to provide Shopify with their product offerings, prices, shipping options, and other business preferences. Some merchants elect to embed Shopify assets, such as payment forms, into their own websites, while Shopify, which creates all the code necessary to implement the product catalogue and accept payment, hosts others. In either case, Shopify collects and validates the consumer’s payment. And

Shopify sends executable JavaScript code to consumers’ computers or mobile devices, which then load and execute the code to display the payment form. However, the merchant whose product or service the consumer is purchasing appears to generate the payment form itself on the consumer’s computer screen, and the screen does not identify Shopify’s role in the transaction. In this case, neither the IABMFG checkout nor payment form mentions Shopify. Thus, only a person with technical knowledge and specialized software tools could discern that Shopify generated the forms, which here involved downloading eight separate files onto Briskin’s cell phone to generate

The SAC asserts that these practices violate California data privacy and access laws and constitute unfair and deceptive practices. 7 The three named defendants filed three separate motions to dismiss the SAC on several grounds.

The district court dismissed the SAC under Rule 8(a)(2) because it was collectively pleaded and therefore failed to specify which named defendant was responsible for which of Briskin’s alleged injuries. As for personal jurisdiction, the district court first noted that Briskin did not argue that the court has general personal jurisdiction over any of the three Shopify 7 Specifically, the SAC alleges claims for invasion of privacy in violation of the California Invasion of Privacy Act, California Penal Code Sections 631(a), 635,

so.   Id.  at 424.  A majority of the active judges of our court 
voted to rehear this appeal en banc.  Having done so, we now

8  On this record, we have no basis for determining whether Shopify is 
subject to general personal jurisdiction in California.  First, the district 
court denied Briskin’s request for jurisdictional discovery.  Second, 
Briskin never argued that the California courts have general personal 
jurisdiction over Shopify.  Therefore, he has waived that argument.  
Judge Callahan’s suggestion that “perhaps the panel did not go far 
enough” is speculative at best and has no bearing on whether Shopify’s 
actions here are sufficient to establish specific personal jurisdiction. 9  We therefore do not reach the issue of whether Briskin was entitled to 
jurisdictional discovery.

</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC002.P018.B03">
A. Personal Jurisdiction
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC002.P018.B04">
Here, no applicable federal statute confers personal jurisdiction upon the federal district court. We therefore apply the law of the state in which the district court sits— here, California. Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(1)(A); Herbal Brands, Inc. v. Photoplaza, Inc. , 72 F.4th 1085, 1089 (9th Cir. 2023). The California long-arm statute, Cal Civ. Proc. Code § 410.10, provides for personal jurisdiction to the maximum extent that the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause allows. World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson , 444 U.S. 286, 291 (1980). For a court to exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant, that defendant must have
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC002.P018.B05">
“certain minimum contacts” with California “such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend ‘traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.’” Mavrix Photo , 647 F.3d at 1223 (quoting Int’l Shoe Co. v. Washington , 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945)).

B RISKIN V . S HOPIFY , I NC . 19 B. Specific Personal Jurisdiction A nonresident corporation may be subject to either general or specific personal jurisdiction. General personal jurisdiction allows a court to hear “any and all claims against [defendants] when their affiliations with the State are so ‘continuous and systematic’ as to render them essentially at home in the forum State.” Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. Brown , 564 U.S. 915, 919 (2011); Ford Motor Co. v. Mont. Eighth Jud. Dist. Ct. , 592 U.S. 351, 358– 59 (2021). None of the Shopify entities resides in
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC002.P019.B02">
the State of California, and Briskin does not attempt to make a showing that Shopify’s contacts with California are so substantial, continuous, and systematic that it would be consistent with “traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice” to hale Shopify into California courts for any of its activities across the nation.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC002.P019.B03">
We therefore must turn to longstanding principles governing the exercise of specific personal jurisdiction. The Supreme Court has long interpreted International Shoe ’s inquiry into whether a forum state may assert specific jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant to require that courts focus on “the relationship among the defendant, the forum, and the litigation.” Walden v. Fiore , 571 U.S. 277, 283–84 (2014) (quoting Keeton v. Hustler Mag., Inc. , 465 U.S. 770, 775 (1984)) (“In judging minimum contacts, a court properly focuses on ‘the relationship among the defendant, the forum, and the litigation’” (quoting Shaffer v. Heitner , 433 U.S.

186, 204 (1977))); Int’l Shoe Co. , 326 U.S. at 316, 320. We analyze specific personal jurisdiction under a three-part test: (1) The non-resident defendant must purposefully direct his activities or

or resident thereof; or perform some act by 
which he purposefully avails himself of the 
privilege of conducting activities in the 
forum, thereby invoking the benefits and 
protections of its laws; (2) the claim must be one which arises out of 
or relates to the defendant’s forum-related 
activities; and (3) the exercise of jurisdiction must comport 
with fair play and substantial justice, i.e. it 
must be reasonable.

Briskin bears the burden of satisfying the first two 
prongs of the test.   Sher v. Johnson , 911 F.2d 1357, 1361 
(9th Cir. 1990).  If Briskin fails to meet this burden, 
California courts lack specific personal jurisdiction.  If 
Briskin succeeds, then the burden shifts to Shopify to 
“present a compelling case that the presence of some other 
considerations would render jurisdiction unreasonable.”  
Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz , 471 U.S. 462, 477 (1985).

“ Calder  effects” test, which “focuses on the forum in which 
the defendant’s actions were felt, whether or not the actions 
themselves occurred within the forum.”   Mavrix Photo , 647 
F.3d at 1228 (quoting  Yahoo! Inc. v. La Ligue Contre Le 
Racisme Et L’Antisemitisme , 433 F.3d 1199, 1206 (9th Cir.

</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC002.P021.B02">
The effects test is drawn from the Supreme Court’s decision in Calder v. Jones , 465 U.S. 783 (1984). There, the Court found that a California Superior Court had specific personal jurisdiction over the National Enquirer, a Florida corporation with its principal place of business in Florida. The newspaper’s reporter and editor also resided in Florida, but their allegedly libelous story was distributed in California, and was about a well-known actress who resided in California and was alleged to have injured her there by causing her emotional distress and harming her reputation. Id. at 784–86. The Supreme Court reasoned that
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC002.P021.B03">
the defendants’ intentional and allegedly tortious actions “were expressly aimed at California,” that the defendants knew of the article’s “potentially devastating impact” upon the actress, and that the “brunt of that injury would be felt [by the actress] in the State in which she lives and works.” Id. at 789 – 90. Under those circumstances, the defendants “must ‘reasonably anticipate being haled into court [in California]’ to answer for the truth of the statements made in [their] article.” Id. at 790 (quoting World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. , 444 U.S. at 297).

<BLOCK id="DOC002.P022.B01">
22 B RISKIN V . S HOPIFY , I NC . Thus, the purposeful direction test requires that the defendant (1) commit an intentional act, that is (2) expressly aimed at the forum state, and (3) which causes harm that the defendant knows will be suffered in the forum state. Brayton Purcell LLP v. Recordon & Recordon , 606 F.3d 1124, 1128 (9th Cir. 2010) (quoting Yahoo! Inc. , 433 F.3d at 1206). This test does not require that the defendant be physically present in the forum state, as “it is an inescapable fact of modern commercial life that a
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC002.P022.B02">
substantial amount of business is transacted solely by mail and wire communications across state lines, thus obviating the need for physical presence within a State in which business is conducted.” Burger King , 471 U.S. at 476. “So long as a commercial actor’s efforts are ‘purposefully directed’ toward residents of another State, [the Supreme Court has] consistently rejected the notion that an absence of physical contacts can defeat personal jurisdiction there.” Id. Most relevant here is the second prong of the Calder effects test and the determination of when internet contacts between a defendant and a given forum state are
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC002.P022.B03">
sufficient to show express aiming at that forum state. C. Specific Personal Jurisdiction in the Internet Age For almost three decades, we have applied these traditional jurisdictional principles to the ever-evolving worlds of technology, electronic communication, and e- commerce. In 1997, we addressed for the first time specific personal jurisdiction over a passive website that had done nothing more in the forum state than advertise on the internet. Cybersell, Inc. v. Cybersell, Inc. , 130 F.3d 414 (9th Cir. 1997). We applied our “normal ‘minimum contacts’ analysis” to conclude that Arizona did not have “personal jurisdiction over an allegedly infringing

We noted that courts addressing more interactive sites “have looked to the ‘level of interactivity and commercial nature of the exchange of information that occurs on the Web site’ to determine if sufficient contacts exist to warrant the exercise of jurisdiction.” Id. at 418 (quoting Zippo Mfg. Co. v. Zippo Dot Com, Inc. , 952 F. Supp. 1119, 1124 (W.D. Pa 1997)). We observed that no court has ever held that
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC002.P023.B02">
an Internet advertisement alone is sufficient to subject the advertiser to jurisdiction in the plaintiff’s home state. Rather, in each, there has been “something more” to indicate that the defendant purposefully (albeit electronically) directed his activity in a substantial way to the forum state.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC002.P023.B03">
Id.  (citation omitted).   Cybersell  thus recognized two 
significant concepts that advanced our thinking about 
specific personal jurisdiction as applied to conduct occurring 
in cyberspace.  First, it recognized that contacts with the 
forum state could be in the form of electronic contacts, and 
second, it established that “something more” than mere 
passive nationwide accessibility was required to show 
express aiming at the forum state and, thus, satisfy due 
process.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC002.P023.B04">
We were then confronted with new factual scenarios, 
requiring us to examine what actions by a defendant 
constituted the “something more” that would subject the 
defendant to specific personal jurisdiction.  The first such 
case,  Panavision International, L.P. v. Toeppen , 141 F.3d

(“NSI”), representing that (1) he had the right to use the requested domain name; (2) that his use of the domain name did not impair or infringe on any third parties’ trademarks or other intellectual property right; and (3) that he was not seeking to use the domain name for any unlawful purpose. Id. at 1318– 19. When Panavision learned of defendant Toeppen’s registration of its

We held that “something more” had been shown that established express aiming of tortious conduct toward California, reasoning that “Toeppen engaged in a scheme to register Panavision’s trademarks as his domain names for the purpose of extorting money from Panavision” and that Toeppen’s “conduct, as he knew it likely would, had the effect of injuring Panavision in California,” its principal place of business and the center of the movie and

foreign business entity that engaged in online sports 
gambling for trademark infringement of its trademark in 
federal district court in Nevada.   Id.  at 1012.  We rejected the

merely operating a passive website because RIO had alleged 
“something more—conduct directly targeting the forum . . .

In Pebble Beach Co. v. Caddy , 453 F.3d 1151 (9th Cir. 2006), we relied on Panavision and Rio to conclude that we must find “‘something more’ than just a foreseeable effect” in the forum state and that “[a] [potentially infringing] internet domain name and [a] passive website” that merely advertised its British bed and breakfast on its website had not engaged in the “something more” that could subject a foreign entity to jurisdiction in California for trademark infringement.

And “both publications cultivated their nationwide audiences for commercial gain.” Id. Neither publication “could characterize the consumption of its products in any state as ‘random,’ ‘fortuitous,’ or ‘attenuated.’” Id.

Our most recent foray into the e-commerce world

A collectively pleaded complaint may fail to provide fair notice to a defendant, where there are multiple defendants and claims, and the complaint fails to differentiate among them.

Because no federal statute purports to authorize the exercise of personal jurisdiction over any of the Defendants in this case, Plaintiff Brandon Briskin’s service of summonses upon them “establishes personal jurisdiction” over them if they are “subject to the jurisdiction of a court of general jurisdiction in the state where the district court is located.” F ED .

Harrah’s Ent., Inc. , 112 P.3d 28, 32 (Cal. 2005), the district court’s jurisdiction in this case turns solely on whether asserting personal jurisdiction here “comports with the limits imposed by federal due process.” Daimler AG v.

As a factual matter there is no serious dispute, on the current record, that the alleged conduct that assertedly violated California law occurred, in substantial part, in California. Several of the alleged violations of California law occurred when Defendants’ software connected with Briskin’s cellphone in California, intercepted data that he was led to believe he was transmitting from his cellphone in California to a California retailer, and implanted a tracking cookie onto his cellphone in California. That suffices to bring this case within the settled principle that, “because torts involve wrongful conduct which a state seeks to deter, and against

Although the majority now clarifies that the “something more” need not be differential targeting, it reaffirms our long-stated “something more” requirement. See Opin. at 23. Those two propositions are in some tension with one another, because the most obvious way to show “something more” than universal availability of a website is differential favoring of the use of that website in some forums versus others.

I would go further and disavow, as unhelpful and confusing, our oft-repeated statements that “something more” than a “passive” or “interactive” website is required. See , e.g. , Cybersell, Inc. v. Cybersell, Inc. , 130 F.3d 414, 418 (9th Cir. 1997). As the briefing in this case illustrates, litigants have seized on such phrasing as effectively creating a safe harbor for internet companies that must be protected and expanded in order to avoid the supposed horror that such companies might be subject to personal jurisdiction in all 50 States. I am at a loss to understand why there should be

For the foregoing reasons, I concur in the judgment reversing the district court’s dismissal of this action. BUMATAY, Circuit Judge, concurring: We took this case en banc to answer a narrow question: Does the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment require “differential targeting” of a forum to assert personal jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant? By “differential targeting,” we mean that the defendant’s actions within a forum State create specific jurisdiction only if the defendant acted with “some prioritization of the forum state”—rather than a general, nationwide focus.

Under a differential-targeting regime, a corporate defendant with a global reach doesn’t act sufficiently within a forum unless the defendant expressly “differentiat[ed . . .] the forum state from other locations.” See id. In other words, the defendant must have directed its actions to the forum State over-and-above other fora. So if a corporate defendant operates a broadly accessible website or electronic service, no specific jurisdiction exists over the defendant in a particular State unless the State is a “focal point” of the service, or the platform has a “forum-specific focus.”

Regardless of that debate, “[b]oth at the time of the founding and the Fourteenth Amendment’s adoption, the Anglo-American legal tradition recognized that a tribunal’s competence was generally constrained only by the ‘territorial limits’ of the sovereign that created it.” Mallory , 600 U.S. at 128.

1  To be sure, it is the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause that 
initially governs federal courts’ personal jurisdiction inquiry.  But when 
hearing diversity cases, Congress directs us to state law.   See  Federal 
Rule of Civil Procedure 4(k)(1)(A) (service of a summons establishes 
personal jurisdiction over a defendant “who is subject to the jurisdiction 
of a court of general jurisdiction in the state where the district court is 
located.”).  And the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause governs 
state courts.

B RISKIN V . S HOPIFY , I NC . Indeed, an unbroken chain of cases, from the Founding 
to  Pennoyer  to  International Shoe , has interpreted “due 
process of law” under either the Fifth Amendment or the 
Fourteenth Amendment to permit court jurisdiction over 
defendants physically present within the forum state.  Thus, 
under any conception of the original public meaning of “due 
process of law,” physical presence satisfies it.

Of course, much has changed since the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment. First, “the use of the corporate form proliferated in the 19th century.” Mallory , 600 U.S. at 129. Second, technology has revolutionized commerce. Now, instead of shopkeepers hawking goods and wares at the corner market, the internet offers convenient ways to buy and sell products from almost anywhere. These developments may challenge our traditional sense of physical presence. But that doesn’t mean the original meaning of the Due Process Clause has nothing to say. “When confronting . . . present-day” challenges, to be faithful to the original Constitution,

So, in determining personal jurisdiction over out-of-state 
corporate defendants today, our analysis must focus on an 
“analogy to ‘physical presence’”—“the touchstone of 
jurisdiction.”   Burnham , 495 U.S. at 619.  Under that view, 
if a corporate defendant’s activity in a forum State is 
analogous to physical presence, it doesn’t matter whether the 
defendant also  targeted  the forum State over other States.  
We thus shouldn’t construe our precedent as requiring a 
differential-targeting regime to assert personal jurisdiction.

Under the first view, the Due Process Clause simply requires state courts to follow state law before they may lawfully issue judgments. Before the Fourteenth Amendment, when a state court issued a judgment, it would of course be enforced inside the State’s own borders. See Patrick J. Borchers, The Death of the Constitutional Law of Personal Jurisdiction: From Pennoyer to Burnham and Back Again , 24 U.C. Davis L. Rev. 19, 30 (1990). But outside the State’s borders, enforcement was up to other States, subject to federal full faith and credit commands. Id. at 32. Recognition of one State’s judgments
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC002.P060.B04">
by other States was governed by “international rules of jurisdiction.” Id . Thus, if an out-of-state defendant believed a state court failed to follow state law on jurisdiction, the defendant’s recourse was to take a default judgment and then challenge recognition of the judgment in the defendant’s home-state courts. See id. at 26 n.25. But this arrangement left no federal means for a defendant to challenge, within a State, a judgment entered by that State’s courts for lack of jurisdiction. See id. at 42.

The Fourteenth Amendment’s innovation, under this

recognition of the judgment was sought interstate or 
intrastate.”   Id.  at 40.  But, importantly, the Clause did not

Under our circuit’s newly divined rule, when a company attaches cookies to a person’s electronic device, jurisdiction attaches wherever that person happens to be, and indeed, wherever that person happens to travel thereafter. Of course, this is nowhere close to the Supreme Court’s personal jurisdiction doctrine, as it “impermissibly allows a plaintiff’s contacts with the defendant and forum to drive the jurisdictional analysis.” Id. at 289.

Id. at 788 2 The traveling cookie rule is also not administrable. What would happen if Briskin chose to fly home from Oregon and then made another purchase using the plane’s Internet? Would the parties have to litigate which State the plane was flying over as it was 30,000 feet above ground? The majority opinion does not attempt to answer this, likely because its rule breaks into pieces when tested.

3  The majority opinion says that it does not look  only  to where Briskin 
was located at the time of purchase, because it focuses “on the 
relationship among the defendant [Shopify], the forum [California], and 
the litigation [over tortious acts committed in California].”  Opinion at

Like the California state court in  Kulko , the majority’s

presence in California could not establish the ex-husband’s 
contacts with the State, then Briskin’s physical presence in 
California cannot establish Shopify’s contacts with the State 
either. And if the ex-husband’s “acquiescence” to his ex-

matter in  Kulko , Shopify’s “acquiescence” to Briskin being 
physically present in California (or any other State) should 
not matter here either.

In sum, the majority opinion holds that Briskin’s 
physical presence in California is dispositive to the State’s 
exercise of specific personal jurisdiction.  Doing so 
impermissibly allows a plaintiff’s contacts with the forum 
State to drive the jurisdictional analysis and focuses on the 
“unilateral activity” of the plaintiff.   Kulko , 436 U.S .  at 93–

I share the majority’s concern that plaintiffs like Brandon Briskin have a convenient forum to vindicate their claims against large multinational corporations like Shopify. However, I fundamentally disagree with the majority’s approach, which subjects Shopify to specific jurisdiction in California simply because Shopify placed a cookie on Briskin’s device while he was “located in California.” availment” of the forum. Even assuming Shopify “purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within [California],” Ford Motor Co. v. Mont. Eighth Jud. Dist.

Shopify’s extraction and processing of his personal information has nothing to do with Shopify’s physical presence in the State, like its contracts with California merchants, its fulfillment center, or its physical store. And as the majority opinion even acknowledges, Briskin’s alleged injury arises out of and relates to “Shopify’s contact with Briskin’s device,” Opinion at 39, and not Shopify’s contacts with the forum.

Although the majority rejected Briskin’s request for jurisdictional discovery, such discovery could have been helpful to discern the location of Shopify’s servers. Companies operating on the Internet “choose to host their site on servers near their desired audience” because “[t]he closer a viewer is located physically or geographically to the host server, the faster that page will load for the viewer.” Will Co., Ltd. v. Lee , 47 F.4th 917, 925 (9th Cir. 2022). Courts have thus routinely found the location of a nonresident defendant’s servers to be a relevant jurisdictional fact. See, e.g. , id. at 920; XMission, L.C.

Briskin alleged that his data was “sent directly to Shopify’s servers” and that Shopify’s software caused his device “to connect to Shopify’s computer servers,” but it is unknown whether these servers are located in California. If they are, then Briskin’s alleged injuries likely “arise out of” these forum-based contacts.

72 B RISKIN V . S HOPIFY , I NC . Opinion at 11. Such a view turns Supreme Court precedent on its head by focusing solely on the plaintiff’s contacts with the forum, and eviscerates any meaning to “express aiming” under Calder . Now, instead of having to “expressly aim” conduct at a forum, jurisdiction attaches if the company fails to “expressly avoid” a forum. 6 Perhaps the answer to this case lies where no one is looking. Although Briskin does not argue that Shopify is subject to general jurisdiction in the State, Shopify’s contractual agreements with California merchants,

Ct. of Cal. , 495 U.S. 604, 610 (1990) (plurality opinion of Scalia, J.), which should be enough to make the assertion of jurisdiction “consistent with due process,” id. at 609. “The Constitution has always allowed suits against individuals on any issue in any State where they set foot,” Ford Motor Co. , 592 U.S. at 384 n.5 (Gorsuch, J., concurring), and I see no reason why there should be “a jurisdictional windfall to large multistate or multinational

By focusing on Shopify placing cookies on Briskin’s device as the relevant contact for specific, i.e., “case-linked jurisdiction,” BNSF , 581 U.S. at 413, the majority opinion dodges the more pressing question in this case, which is whether Shopify’s deep connections and presence in the State of California can reasonably subject the company to general, i.e., “all-purpose jurisdiction,” id.

The majority’s traveling cookie rule sweeps together all

once has the Supreme Court endorsed such an expansive 
view of jurisdiction.  Because the majority’s approach 
impermissibly manufactures jurisdiction wherever the

defendant’s failure to avoid a forum creates the requisite 
“minimum contacts,” I respectfully dissent.

7  The majority opinion avoids holding that Shopify has “virtual

Walden , 571 U.S. at 290 n.9, but it may be that Shopify’s operations in 
California make it so that it is indeed virtually “present” in the State the 
same way it is physically “present.”
