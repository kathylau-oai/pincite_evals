His claims arise out of a dispute over the contents of a dog-pedigree soft- ware program he developed by lifting data from the defendants’ websites. He alleges the defendants used the Internet to retaliate against him for copying their online data, which he contends was in the public domain. The defendants are a Canadian proprietor of a dog-pedigree website who has never visited or transacted business in Illinois; three Americans who likewise maintain dog- pedigree websites and are residents of Colorado, Michigan, and Ohio with only sporadic contacts with Illinois; and

Tamburo alleges that the individual Canadian and American defendants engaged in a concerted campaign of blast emails and postings on their websites accusing him of stealing their data and urging dog enthusiasts to boy- cott his products. He also claims they sent some of these messages to the owner of the Australian company, who reposted them to a private dog-breeder listserve. These emails and Internet postings, Tamburo claims, violate federal and state antitrust laws, were defamatory and tortiously interfered with his software business, and constituted a civil conspiracy to boot. The defendants moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction

3 We affirm in part and reverse in part. First, Tamburo’s
federal and state antitrust allegations are woefully inade-
quate under  Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544
(2007); we affirm the dismissal of those claims on the
alternative basis that they fail to state a claim. Without
a viable federal claim, personal jurisdiction is deter-
mined under Illinois’ long-arm statute, which authorizes
jurisdiction to the full extent permitted by the United

Applying Calder v. Jones , 465 U.S. 783 (1984), we conclude that specific personal jurisdiction lies in Illinois over the individual Canadian and American defendants on Tamburo’s intentional tort claims. These defendants are alleged to have used their websites — or in the case of the Canadian defendant, blast emails to the online dog- pedigree community — to defame and tortiously generate a consumer boycott against Tamburo, knowing that he lived and operated his software business in Illinois and would be injured there. Indeed, some of the messages specifically listed Tamburo’s Illinois address and urged readers to harass him. This

is enough for a prima facie case of personal jurisdiction under Calder ’s “express aiming” test for personal jurisdiction in intentional-tort cases. The case for personal jurisdiction over the Australian company is much weaker. Tamburo alleged only that the owner of the company received messages from the other defendants and reposted them on a private listserve. There is no allegation that he disseminated the messages more broadly or that he knew that Tamburo operated his business in Illinois. Accordingly, Tamburo’s allega-

John Tamburo, doing business as Man’s Best Friend
Software, lives and operates his business in Illinois. He
designs software for use by dog breeders and noncommer-
cial dog enthusiasts.  One of his products, an online
2 database called The Breeder’s Standard, provides custom-
ers with access to dog-pedigree information. To create the
database, Tamburo developed an automated computer
program that scanned the Internet for information
about dog pedigrees. He then incorporated the data he
retrieved into The Breeder’s Standard.

Dworkin, a Canadian citizen who resides in Ottowa, also raises and shows dogs. 3 Tamburo pulled much of the information included in The Breeder’s Standard from the websites operated by Henry, Hayes, Mills, and Dworkin. In retaliation Henry, Hayes, and Mills posted statements on their websites accusing Tamburo of “theft,” “hacking,” and “selling stolen goods,” and calling on readers to boycott his products. They also posted Tamburo’s Illinois address on their websites and urged readers to

contact him to harass him and otherwise complain. Dworkin retaliated in a different way. First, he emailed Tamburo and demanded that he remove the “blatent [sic] theft of data” from The Breeder’s Standard “within 5 days.” If Tamburo failed to do so, Dworkin threatened to “publish to each and every dog[-]based list the sleazy methods” of Tamburo’s operation. When Tamburo did not comply, Dworkin emailed “all persons who had a free online database of dog pedigrees on the Internet” saying that Tamburo’s product contained pedi- gree data that was “stolen,” “mined,” and “harvested” for improper “commercial use,” and suggested that

He also sought damages for federal and state antitrust violations and asserted claims for defamation, tortious interfer- ence with existing contracts and prospective economic advantage, trade libel, and civil conspiracy under Illinois law. 5 The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction and

A. Antitrust Claims In Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544 (2007), the Supreme Court clarified the pleading requirements for antitrust claims: “[A] formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do. Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.” Id. at 555-56 (citations and all caps omitted). “Because § 1 of the Sherman Act does not prohibit [all] unreasonable restraints of trade . . . but only restraints effected by a contract, combination, or conspiracy, . . .

Accordingly, a complaint alleging an antitrust claim must contain “enough factual matter (taken as true) to suggest that an agreement was made .” Id. at 556. In addition, depending on the nature of the claim, the complaint must plausibly plead the existence of an antitrust injury; this requires factual allegations suggesting that the “claimed injuries are of the type the

anticompetitive acts made possible by the violation.”

<BLOCK id="DOC008.P008.B02">
Tamburo’s antitrust claims are pleaded in a wholly conclusory fashion; as such, it is hard to tell what kind of antitrust violation he is trying to assert. The com- plaint contains no factual allegations suggesting the existence of an antitrust conspiracy or an antitrust injury. The federal claim alleges only that the defendants pos- sessed “monopoly power in the relevant market of dog breeding data,” which they acquired “by means of anticompetitive and/or predatory conduct,” and that this “violated provisions of Federal Antitrust statutes including 15 U.S.C. [§§] 1, et seq .” This appears to sweep in the entire gamut
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC008.P008.B03">
of federal antitrust violations, but there are no allegations whatsoever regarding an antitrust injury. The complaint alleges only that Tamburo “has been damaged” as a result of “the wrongful acts of Defendants.” This manner of pleading a federal antitrust claim is plainly improper under Twombly .
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC008.P008.B04">
Tamburo’s attempt to plead a state-law antitrust viola-
tion fares no better. The complaint asserts a claim under
the Illinois Antitrust Act, 740 I LL . C OMP . S TAT . 10/1  et seq .,
which parallels the federal Sherman and Clayton Acts.
But this section of the complaint simply repeats the
inadequate allegations contained in the federal antitrust
claim. Because federal pleading standards apply when

Both juris- dictional bases, however, require a claim arising under federal law. Because Tamburo failed to adequately plead a federal antitrust claim, these jurisdictional options drop out of the case. We note for completeness that the circuits are divided over the proper interpretation of the venue and service-of- process language in § 22 of the Clayton Act. See In re Auto.

circuit has not yet addressed the matter, and because we are affirming the dis- missal of the federal antitrust claim for failure to state a claim, we need not do so here. Moreover, as Tamburo’s counsel properly conceded at oral argument, the presence of a claim under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201, does not supply a basis for acquiring personal jurisdiction over the defendants under Rule 4(k)(1)(C) or Rule 4(k)(2). See Commercial Nat’l Bank of Chi. v. Demos , 18 F.3d 485, 490 (7th Cir. 1994).

Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S.A. v. Hall , 466 U.S. 408, 416 (1984). The threshold for general jurisdiction is high; the contacts must be sufficiently extensive and pervasive to approxi- mate physical presence. Purdue Research Found. , 338 F.3d at 787 & n.16. As such, isolated or sporadic contacts — such as occasional visits to the forum state — are insufficient for

Illinois cannot exercise general personal jurisdiction over any of the defendants in this case. Henry has been to Illinois only twice in ten years. Hayes has been to Illinois approximately 5 times and has placed 13 dogs with families in Illinois but did not receive any profits from these placements. She sold three copies of her book to individuals in Illinois through her website. Mills grew up in Illinois but moved away in 1979 and has only trav- eled back twice since then. Dworkin, the Canadian defen- dant, has never “been to, stopped in or passed through” Illinois. Each of

the individual defendants maintains a public website obviously accessible by Illinois residents, but as we have noted, that is not enough to establish general personal jurisdiction. Finally, Wild Systems, the corporate defendant, is an Australian company located in New South Wales, Australia. It has no offices in Illinois (or anywhere in the United States, for that matter),
</BLOCK>

13 nor has it ever had a distributor in Illinois. Since it was
incorporated in 1996, Wild Systems has had a total of
$8,634 in sales to customers in Illinois. These sporadic
contacts with Illinois do not approach the level of “contin-
uous and systematic” contacts necessary to establish
general personal jurisdiction.

<BLOCK id="DOC008.P013.B02">
2. Specific Personal Jurisdiction The question of specific personal jurisdiction is much more difficult. To support an exercise of specific per- sonal jurisdiction, the defendant’s contacts with the forum state must directly relate to the challenged con- duct or transaction; we therefore evaluate specific per- sonal jurisdiction by reference to the particular conduct underlying the claims made in the lawsuit. See GCIU- Employer Ret. Fund , 565 F.3d at 1024. Specific personal jurisdiction is appropriate where (1) the defendant has purposefully directed his activities at the forum state or purposefully availed himself of the privilege of con- ducting business in
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC008.P013.B03">
that state, and (2) the alleged injury arises out of the defendant’s forum-related activities. Burger King , 471 U.S. at 472. The exercise of specific per- sonal jurisdiction must also comport with traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice as required by the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. Int’l Shoe , 326 U.S. at 316. This case primarily concerns the question whether the defendants “purposefully directed” their conduct at the forum state.
</BLOCK>

<BLOCK id="DOC008.P014.B01">
14 No. 08-2406 a. Conduct “purposefully directed” at the forum state The purposeful-direction inquiry “can appear in dif- ferent guises.” Dudnikov v. Chalk & Vermilion Fine Arts, Inc. , 514 F.3d 1063, 1071 (10th Cir. 2008). Personal jurisdiction in breach-of-contract actions often turns on whether the defendant “purposefully availed” himself of the privilege of conducting business or engaging in a transaction in the forum state. See id. ; Schwarzenegger v. Fred Martin Motor Co. , 374 F.3d 797, 802 (9th Cir. 2004). But where, as here, the plaintiff’s claims are for intentional torts, the inquiry focuses on whether the conduct
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC008.P014.B02">
underlying the claims was purposely directed at the forum state. Dudnikov , 514 F.3d at 1071; see also Calder v. Jones , 465 U.S. 783, 790 (1984). In all cases the point of the pur- poseful-direction requirement is to “ensure that an out-of- state defendant is not bound to appear to account for merely ‘random, fortuitous, or attenuated contacts’ with the forum state.” Dudnikov , 514 F.3d at 1071 (quoting Burger King , 471 U.S. at 475).
</BLOCK>

The Supreme Court’s decision in  Calder  provides some
contours for the “purposeful direction” requirement in the
context of a suit alleging intentional torts.  Calder  gave
significant weight to the “effects” of a foreign defendant’s
conduct within the forum state. In  Calder  actress Shirley
Jones — star of movie musicals and the 1970s television
show  The Partridge Family — filed suit in California
against the  National Enquirer , its local distributor, and the
writer and editor of an allegedly libelous article that
appeared in the  Enquirer . 465 U.S. at 785-86. The  Enquirer

No. 08-2406 15 the writer and editor were Florida residents; the individual defendants challenged personal jurisdiction in California. They argued that they were not responsible for the tabloid’s distribution in California and had no economic stake in the publication’s sales there, and the fact that they could foresee the article would be distrib- uted and have an effect on Jones in California was not sufficient to confer personal jurisdiction. The Supreme Court disagreed, focusing on the effects of the article on its target in California: “[P]etitioners are not charged with mere untargeted negligence. Rather, their intentional, and allegedly tortious, actions
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC008.P015.B02">
were expressly aimed at Cali- fornia.” Id. As the Court explained, Petitioner South wrote and petitioner Calder edited an article that they knew would have a potentially devas- tating impact upon [Jones]. And they knew that the brunt of that injury would be felt by respondent in the State in which she lives and works and in which the National Enquirer has its largest circulation. Under these circumstances, petitioners must reason- ably anticipate being haled into court there to answer for the truth of the statements made in their article. An individual injured in California need not go to Florida
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC008.P015.B03">
to seek redress from persons who, though remaining in Florida, knowingly cause[d] the injury in California. Id. at 789-90 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Calder thus suggests three requirements for personal jurisdiction in this context: (1) intentional conduct (or

No. 08-2406 “intentional and allegedly tortious” conduct); (2) expressly
aimed at the forum state; (3) with the defendant’s knowl-
edge that the effects would be felt — that is, the plaintiff
would be injured — in the forum state.  See Dudnikov , 514
F.3d at 1072;  IMO Indus., Inc. v. Kiekert AG , 155 F.3d 254,
265-66 (3d Cir. 1998). Extracting these requirements from
Calder  is reasonably straightforward; applying them in
specific cases — especially cases like this one alleging
tortious acts committed over the Internet — is more chal-
lenging. 7

The parties and the district court have approached the 7 jurisdictional question in this case by reference to the specialized framework proposed in Zippo Manufacturing Co. v. Zippo Dot Com, Inc. , 952 F. Supp. 1119 (W.D. Pa. 1997), for cases in which the challenged conduct occurs over the Internet. Zippo devised an alternative minimum-contacts test for Internet-based claims.

that involve the knowing and repeated transmission of
computer files over the Internet, personal jurisdiction is

passive Web site that does little more than make infor-

grounds for the exercise [of] personal jurisdiction. The
middle ground is occupied by interactive Web sites

determined by examining the level of interactivity and
commercial nature of the exchange of information that

Some circuits have followed Zippo when “electronic contacts” over the Internet are at issue. See, e.g. , Revel v. Lidov , 317 F.3d 467, 470 (5th Cir. 2002) (“This circuit has drawn upon the approach of Zippo . . . in determining whether the operation of an internet site can support minimum contacts necessary for the exercise of personal jurisdiction.”); ALS Scan, Inc. v.

“Express aiming” and knowledge that plaintiff
would be injured in forum state In  Calder  the Supreme Court emphasized that the defen-
dants were not “charged with mere untargeted negli-
gence,” but instead had “expressly aimed” their alleged
libel at California, where they knew Jones lived and
worked and would suffer the “brunt of th[e] injury.”
465 U.S. at 789-90. As an analytical matter,  Calder’ s “ex-
press aiming” inquiry overlaps with the question
whether the defendant knew the plaintiff would suffer
the injury in the forum state, so we consider the two
requirements together.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC008.P019.B03">
Some circuits have read  Calder’ s “express aiming”
requirement fairly broadly, requiring only conduct that
is “targeted at a plaintiff whom the defendant knows to
be a resident of the forum state .” Bancroft & Masters, Inc. v.
Augusta Nat’l Inc. , 223 F.3d 1082, 1087 (9th Cir. 2000).
Others have read it more narrowly to require that the
forum state be the “focal point of the tort.”  Dudnikov ,
514 F.3d at 1074 n.9;  see also IMO Indus., Inc. , 155 F.3d at
263-65 (“the  Calder  ‘effects test’ can only be satisfied if
the plaintiff can point to contacts which demonstrate that
the defendant  expressly aimed  its tortious conduct at the

tortious activity”);  ESAB Group, Inc. v. Centricut, Inc. , 126
F.3d 617, 625 (4th Cir. 1997) (conduct must be “intention-
ally targeted at and focused on” the forum state).
Our circuit hasn’t firmly settled on either of these under-
standings of  Calder ’s “express aiming” requirement.
Indeed, two of our decisions — Wallace v. Herron , 778 F.2d
391 (7th Cir. 1985), and  Janmark, Inc. v. Reidy , 132 F.3d 1200
(7th Cir. 1997) — are in some tension regarding the
proper reading of  Calder .
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC008.P020.B02">
In Wallace the question was whether Indiana could exercise jurisdiction over California defendants who were sued by an Indiana resident for malicious prosecution when the allegedly tortious conduct occurred exclusively in California. Applying Calder , we held that jurisdiction was not proper in Indiana; in so holding we focused on the relationship between the defendants’ actions and the forum state itself, not just on the relationship between those actions and the plaintiff’s injury. 778 F.2d at 395 (noting that the defendants did not undertake any “action that created the necessary connection with Indiana”). We concluded that Calder did not alter

<BLOCK id="DOC008.P020.B03">
the prevailing jurisdictional requirement that the defendant must engage in conduct that “create[s] a ‘substantial connec- tion’ with the forum State.” Id.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC008.P020.B04">
Janmark  took a broader view of  Calder . There, shopping-
cart competitors Janmark and Dreamkeeper sold mini
shopping carts throughout the United States — Dream-
keeper from California and Janmark from Illinois. 132 F.3d
at 1202. Dreamkeeper accused Janmark of infringing its
</BLOCK>

[Page 21]
<BLOCK id="DOC008.P021.B01">
No. 08-2406 21 copyright in a particular shopping-cart design, but Janmark refused Dreamkeeper’s demand to stop manu- facturing the carts. Dreamkeeper contacted a Janmark customer in New Jersey and threatened the customer with a contributory-infringement suit if it did not stop purchasing carts from Janmark. Janmark sued Dream- keeper in Illinois on a variety of intentional-tort and intellectual-property theories, and we held that Illinois could exercise personal jurisdiction over Dreamkeeper. Id. Noting first that “the location of the injury . . . is vital to understanding where the tort occurred,” we made this observation about Calder : “[T]here can be
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC008.P021.B02">
no serious doubt after Calder . . . that the state in which the victim of a tort suffers the injury may entertain a suit against the accused tortfeasor.” Id. We then concluded that “inducing the customers of an Illinois firm to drop their orders can be a tort in Illinois[,] and . . . whether or not it is a tort in Illinois, it is actionable in Illinois.” Id. at 1203. In other words, jurisdiction was proper in Janmark be- cause the defendant’s express aim was to tortiously interfere with an Illinois company’s sales and because the injury occurred

<BLOCK id="DOC008.P021.B03">
in Illinois.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC008.P021.B04">
Another case — one specifically relied on in  Janmark — is
also instructive here.  Indianapolis Colts, Inc. v. Metropolitan
Baltimore Football Club Ltd. Partnership , 34 F.3d 410, 412
(7th Cir. 1994), involved a suit for copyright infringe-
ment by the National Football League’s Indianapolis
Colts against the Canadian Football League’s Baltimore
Colts — the latter team having been established after the
NFL Colts moved from Baltimore to Indianapolis. We held
that jurisdiction in Indiana was proper under  Calder

<BLOCK id="DOC008.P022.B01">

No. 08-2406 because the Indianapolis team’s injury occurred in that
state and because the cable-television broadcasts of the
Canadian team’s games could be considered an “entry”
into Indiana in the same sense that the  Enquirer’ s dis-
tribution of its tabloid was considered an “entry” into
California in  Calder .  Id.  We noted that in  Calder  and in
other cases finding jurisdiction based on the  Calder  ap-
proach, “the defendant had done more than brought
about an injury to an interest located in a particular
state.”  Id.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC008.P022.B02">
Janmark  is hard to reconcile with  Wallace  and to a lesser
extent, with  Indianapolis Colts — at least if  Janmark  is under-
stood as broadly authorizing personal jurisdiction wher-
ever a tort victim is injured.  Both  Wallace  and  Indianapolis
8 Colts  read  Calder  to require a forum-state injury  and
“something more” directed at that state before jurisdic-
tion over a foreign defendant may be considered proper.
Importantly, however, the holding in  Janmark  ultimately
focused on more than the fact that the injury had

To the extent  Janmark  is understood to hold that jurisdiction is
8 proper wherever the injury occurs, at least one of our sister
circuits has questioned it.  See IMO Indus., Inc. , 155 F.3d at 263-64
(“We believe [ Janmark ] interpreted  Calder  too broadly when it
read that case to hold that the state in which the victim of a tort
suffers the injury may entertain a suit against the accused
tortfeasor. . . . [S]uch a broad sweep fails to accommodate
Calder ’s emphasis on the fact that the forum must be the focal
point of the harm and that the defendant must expressly aim
the tortious activity at the forum.” (internal quotation marks
and citation omitted)).

No. 08-2406
23 occurred in Illinois;  Janmark ’s jurisdictional conclusion
was premised on the Illinois-based injury  and  the fact
that the defendant acted with the purpose of interfering
with sales originating in Illinois. Thus, despite its broad
language about  Calder ,  Janmark  ultimately considered the
relationship between the allegedly tortious conduct and the
forum state itself.  See Nerds on Call, Inc. (Indiana) v. Nerds on
Call, Inc. (California) , 598 F. Supp. 2d 913, 919 (S.D. Ind.
2008) (Hamilton, J.) (“In [ Janmark ], the injury was in
Illinois, but Janmark was specifically targeted by a Cali-
fornia company who induced a New Jersey party to
break its contract with Janmark.”).
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC008.P023.B02">
This case involves both a forum-state injury  and  tortious
conduct specifically directed at the forum, making the
forum state the focal point of the tort — at least with
respect to the individual defendants. (We will discuss
the corporate defendant in a moment.) Moreover, if the
cable-television broadcasts of Baltimore Colts football
games could be considered an electronic “entry” into
Indiana for purposes of personal jurisdiction in  Indiana-
polis Colts , then the individual defendants’ use of their
public websites to defame an Illinois-based businessman
and exhort readers to boycott his products can likewise
be conceptualized as an electronic “entry” into Illinois
for jurisdictional purposes.

More specifically, Dworkin, Henry, Hayes, and Mills are
each alleged to have published false and defamatory
statements about Tamburo, either on their public websites

The com- plaint also alleges that Dworkin personally contacted Tamburo by email, accusing him of “theft” and demanding that he remove the “stolen” data from The Breeder’s Standard. Dworkin threatened to expose Tamburo’s “theft” to the online dog-pedigree community if he did not comply. Dworkin, Henry, Hayes, and Mills engaged in this conduct with the knowledge that Tamburo lived in Illinois and operated his business there; their affidavits do not deny this. Thus, although they

acted from points outside the forum state, these defendants specifically aimed their tortious conduct at Tamburo and his business in Illinois with the knowledge that he lived, worked, and would suffer the “brunt of the injury” there. 9 These allegations suffice to establish personal jurisdic-
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC008.P024.B03">
We note the circuits are also divided on the proper way to 9 understand Calder ’s emphasis on the defendant’s knowledge of where the “brunt of the injury” would be suffered. Compare Dudnikov , 514 F.3d at 1072 (requiring the defendant to have “knowledge that the brunt of the injury would be felt in the forum state”) and IMO Indus., Inc. , 155 F.3d at 265 (same), with Yahoo! , 433 F.3d at 1207 (“[T]he ‘brunt’ of the harm need not be suffered in the forum state. If a jurisdictionally sufficient amount of harm is suffered in the forum state,
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC008.P024.B04">
it does not matter that even more harm might have been suffered in another state.”). Again, we need not enter the fray; here, the whole of the injury was suffered in Illinois, and the individual defendants knew that would be the case. As we explain later , however, the same cannot be said of Wild Systems, the Austra- lian corporate defendant.

No. 08-2406 25 tion over these defendants under either a broad or a more restrictive view of Calder . The Tenth Circuit’s decision in Dudnikov supports this conclusion. In Dudnikov a Connecticut-based company notified the online auction host eBay, based in California, that a line of prints featured in an eBay auction infringed its copyright. eBay responded by cancelling the auction for the prints. The online sellers of the prints lived and operated their business in Colorado; they filed a copy- right suit in Colorado against the Connecticut-based company. The district court dismissed the case for lack of personal jurisdiction.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC008.P025.B02">
514 F.3d at 1068-69. In a compre- hensive decision, the Tenth Circuit reversed. Although the Connecticut company’s conduct originated outside of Colorado and was technically directed at eBay in California, its express goal was to halt sales of an online auction item originating in Colorado. This satisfied Calder’ s “express aiming” requirement and was sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction over the Connecticut company in Colorado. Id. at 1075. The court offered the following analogy to help explain its decision:
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC008.P025.B03">
[The defendant’s conduct] is something like a bank
shot in basketball. A player who shoots the ball off of
the backboard intends to hit the backboard, but he
does so in the service of his further intention of
putting the ball into the basket. Here, defendants
intended to send the [copyright notice] to eBay in
California, but they did so with the ultimate purpose
of cancelling plaintiffs’ auction in Colorado. Their
“express aim” thus can be said to have reached into

Although the circumstances here are not easily
analogized to a basketball bank shot, we take the Tenth
Circuit’s point and agree with its analysis. Here, the
individual defendants purposely targeted Tamburo and
his business in Illinois with the express goal of inflicting
commercial and reputational harm on him there, even
though their alleged defamatory and otherwise tortious
statements were circulated more diffusely across the
Internet.  Tortious acts aimed at a target in the forum

See Dudnikov , 514 F.3d at 1078 (“actions that ‘are performed for the very purpose of having their consequences felt in the forum state’ are more than sufficient to support a finding of purposeful direction under Calder ” (quoting Finley v.

Accordingly, we conclude that Dworkin, Henry, Hayes, and Mills “purposefully directed” their activities at Illinois; this prerequisite for the exercise of personal jurisdiction in Illinois

In Keeton the Court held that New Hampshire could exercise jurisdiction over a nationally circulated magazine, based in Ohio, when an article in the magazine defamed a New York resident. Empha- sizing that the magazine “was a national publication aimed at a nationwide audience” and that it “continuously and deliber- ately exploited the [New Hampshire] market,” the Court concluded that “[t]here is no unfairness in calling [the

28 No. 08-2406 facilitated the posting of some of the individual defen- dants’ tortious messages on the company’s private Breedmate Yahoo! email listserve. The complaint does not say how many, nor does it describe the content of the messages that were reposted onto the listserve. It does not allege, for example, that DeJong reposted emails specifically calling for a boycott of Tamburo’s Illinois-based business. And unlike the individual defen- dants, there are no allegations that DeJong or anyone else associated with Wild Systems acted with the knowl- edge that Tamburo operated his business in Illinois or with the specific purpose

In short, we cannot conclude that DeJong’s reposting of an unspecified number of messages of unspecified (but tortious) content to a private listserve of unspecified scope and reach is enough to establish that Wild Systems “expressly aimed” its allegedly tortious con- duct at Illinois. As such, the claims against Wild Systems were properly dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction.

Injury “arises out of” the defendants’ contacts

the jurisdictional inquiry. Tamburo’s injury must “arise

defendants’ contacts with the forum.  See Burger King , 471

Mass. Sch. of Law at Andover, Inc. v. Am. Bar Ass’n , 142 F.3d 26, 35 (1st Cir. 1998). The Ninth and Fifth Circuits, on the other hand, require only that the contacts constitute a but-for cause of the injury. Doe v. Am. Nat’l Red Cross , 112 F.3d 1048,

The Third Circuit has taken a middle-ground approach,
holding that “specific jurisdiction requires a closer and
more direct causal connection than that provided by the
but-for test,” but has not adopted a precise rule, opting
instead to proceed on a case-by-case basis.  O’Connor v.
Sandy Lane Hotel Co. , 496 F.3d 312, 323 (3d Cir. 2007).
Because personal jurisdiction can be conceptualized as a
quid pro quo by which the defendant submits to the

Under this analytical framework, “the rela- tionship between the contacts and the suit can be weaker when the contacts themselves are more extensive.” Dudnikov , 514 F.3d at 1078 (discussing this approach).

Traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice Our final inquiry is whether Illinois’ exercise of personal jurisdiction over Dworkin, Henry, Hayes, and Mills would offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. See Int’l Shoe , 326 U.S. at 316. The following factors are relevant: “the burden on the defendant, the forum State’s interest in adjudicating the dispute, the plaintiff’s interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief, the interstate judicial system’s interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies, and the shared interest of the several States in furthering funda- mental substantive social policies .” Burger
