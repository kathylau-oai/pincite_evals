3 The en banc court concluded that Shopify is subject to 
specific personal jurisdiction in California because 
Shopify’s allegedly tortious actions deliberately targeted 
Briskin in California where: (1) Shopify conceded that its 
geolocation technology allowed it to know that Briskin’s 
device was located in California when it installed cookies on 
Briskin’s device; and (2) Briskin’s complaint alleged that 
Shopify used the data gathered by its cookies to compile 
consumer profiles and then sold them without the 
consumer’s knowledge or consent.  The en banc court 
overruled precedent requiring defendants’ conduct to evince 
“differential targeting” of a specific forum to establish 
specific personal jurisdiction in that forum."

in dismissing Briskin’s complaint on vagueness grounds.  
Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2) requires a short and plain statement

the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.  The en banc

provided sufficient information to give the Shopify entities 
fair notice of the claims against them."

the district court erred in dismissing this action for lack of 
jurisdiction over the Shopify defendants, but his reasoning 
differed in some respects from that of the majority.  To 
establish personal jurisdiction over Defendants in California, 
Briskin must show that each Defendant’s suit-related 
conduct created a substantial connection with California, 
which entails a showing that Briskin’s claims arose out of or 
related to some action by which a given Defendant 
purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting 
activities within the forum State.  In his view, this standard 
is readily satisfied here, because each Defendant allegedly"

determining personal jurisdiction over out-of-state corporate 
defendants, the analysis must focus on an analogy to 
physical presence, and it does not matter whether the

Given the allegations made against the Shopify entities, the

require any targeting of the State to assert personal 
jurisdiction over them."

Briskin’s alleged injuries would have been the same if he purchased an item from a merchant located in Arkansas. Shopify’s extraction and processing of his personal information has nothing to do with Shopify’s physical presence in the State, like its contracts with California merchants, its fulfillment center, or its physical store. And as the majority opinion even acknowledges, Briskin’s alleged injury arises out of and relates to “Shopify’s contact with Briskin’s device,” Opinion at 39, and not Shopify’s contacts with the forum."
