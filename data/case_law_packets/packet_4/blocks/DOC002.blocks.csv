Iqbal’s claim is not that Ashcroft and Mueller “knew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed to subject” him to a discriminatory practice that is left undeﬁned; his allegation is that “they knew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed to subject” him to a"

Iqbal does not say merely that Ashcroft was the architect of some amorphous discrimina tion, or that Mueller was instrumental in an ill-deﬁned con stitutional violation; he alleges that they helped to create the discriminatory policy he has described.

That aside, the majority’s holding that the statements it selects are conclusory cannot be squared with its treatment of certain other allegations in the complaint as nonconclu sory. For example, the majority takes as true the statement that “[t]he policy of holding post-September-11th detainees in highly restrictive conditions of conﬁnement until they were ‘cleared’ by the FBI was approved by Defendants ASHCROFT and MUELLER in discussions in the weeks after September 11, 2001.” Complaint ¶ 69, supra"

This statement makes two points: (1) after September 11, the FBI held certain detainees in highly re strictive conditions, and (2) Ashcroft and Mueller discussed and approved these conditions. If, as the majority says, these allegations are not conclusory, then I cannot see why the majority deems it merely conclusory when Iqbal alleges that (1) after September 11, the FBI designated Arab Mus lim detainees as being of “ ‘high interest’ ” “because of the race, religion, and national origin of the detainees, and not because of any evidence of the detainees’ involvement"

As the Second Circuit explained, where a Government defendant asserts a qualiﬁed immunity defense, a trial court, responsible for managing a case and “mindful of the need to vindicate the purpose of the qualiﬁed immunity defense,” can structure discovery in ways that di minish the risk of imposing unwarranted burdens upon pub lic ofﬁcials.
