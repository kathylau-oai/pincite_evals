OCTOBER TERM, 2006 Per Curiam ERICKSON  v. PARDUS  et al. on petition for writ of certiorari to the united
states court of appeals for the tenth circuit No. 06–7317. Decided June 4, 2007 Petitioner ﬁled suit alleging that respondents, Colorado prison ofﬁcials, 
violated the Eighth Amendment when they terminated his hepatitis C 
treatment program, with life-threatening consequences. The District 
Court granted respondents’ motion to dismiss, and the Tenth Circuit 
afﬁrmed, holding that petitioner’s allegations were too conclusory to es
tablish for pleading purposes that he had suffered a cognizable inde
pendent harm from the termination."
