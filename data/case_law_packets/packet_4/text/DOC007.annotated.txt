[CITE_START:DOC007[P001.B01]] 89 
OCTOBER TERM, 2006 Per Curiam ERICKSON  v. PARDUS  et al. on petition for writ of certiorari to the united
states court of appeals for the tenth circuit No. 06–7317. Decided June 4, 2007 Petitioner ﬁled suit alleging that respondents, Colorado prison ofﬁcials, 
violated the Eighth Amendment when they terminated his hepatitis C 
treatment program, with life-threatening consequences. The District 
Court granted respondents’ motion to dismiss, and the Tenth Circuit 
afﬁrmed, holding that petitioner’s allegations were too conclusory to es
tablish for pleading purposes that he had suffered a cognizable inde
pendent harm from the termination. [CITE_END:DOC007[P001.B01]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P001.B02]] Held: Petitioner’s case cannot be dismissed on the ground that his harm allegations were too conclusory to put these matters in issue. The com plaint—which contains allegations that the decision to remove petitioner from his medication endangered his life, that the medication was with held shortly after he had commenced a 1-year treatment program, that he still needed the treatment, and that the prison ofﬁcials were refusing it—was enough to satisfy Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), which requires only “a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.” Petitioner, in addition, bolstered [CITE_END:DOC007[P001.B02]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P001.B03]] his claim with more speciﬁc allegations in documents attached to the complaint and in later ﬁlings. The Tenth Circuit’s departure from Rule 8(a)(2)’s liberal pleading requirements is especially pronounced here, where peti tioner has been proceeding, from the litigation’s outset, without counsel. Whether the complaint is sufﬁcient in all respects is yet to be deter mined, for respondents have raised multiple arguments in their motion to dismiss. Certiorari granted; 198 Fed. Appx. 694, vacated and remanded. Per Curiam. [CITE_END:DOC007[P001.B03]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P001.B04]] Imprisoned by the State of Colorado and alleging viola
tions of his Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment protections 
against cruel and unusual punishment, William Erickson, the 
petitioner in this Court, ﬁled suit against prison ofﬁcials in 
the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. 
He alleged that a liver condition resulting from hepatitis C 
required a treatment program that ofﬁcials had commenced [CITE_END:DOC007[P001.B04]]

[CITE_START:DOC007[P002.B03]] but then wrongfully terminated, with life-threatening conse
quences. Deeming these allegations, and others to be noted, 
to be “conclusory,” the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Cir
cuit afﬁrmed the District Court’s dismissal of petitioner’s 
complaint. 198 Fed. Appx. 694, 698 (2006). The holding de
parts in so stark a manner from the pleading standard man
dated by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that we grant 
review. We vacate the court’s judgment and remand the 
case for further consideration. [CITE_END:DOC007[P002.B03]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P002.B04]] Petitioner was incarcerated in the Limon Correctional Fa cility in Limon, Colorado, where respondents Barry Pardus and Dr. Anita Bloor were working as prison ofﬁcials. After Dr. Bloor removed petitioner from the hepatitis C treatment he had been receiving, petitioner sued under Rev. Stat. § 1979, 42 U. S. C. § 1983, complaining, inter alia, that Dr. Bloor had violated his Eighth Amendment rights by demonstrating deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs. See, e. g., Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97, 104–105 (1976) (“[D]eliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners constitutes the unnecessary and wanton inﬂiction of [CITE_END:DOC007[P002.B04]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P002.B05]] pain . . . proscribed by the Eighth Amendment,” and this includes “indifference . . . manifested by prison doctors in their response to the prisoner’s needs or by prison guards in intentionally denying or delaying access to medical care or intentionally interfering with the treatment once pre scribed” (footnotes and internal quotation marks omitted)); see also Helling v. McKinney, 509 U. S. 25, 35–37 (1993). [CITE_END:DOC007[P002.B05]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P002.B06]] Petitioner based his claim on the following allegations, 
which we assume to be true for purposes of review here: 
Ofﬁcials at Colorado’s Department of Corrections (De
partment) diagnosed petitioner as requiring treatment for 
hepatitis C. After completing the necessary classes and 
otherwise complying with the protocols set forth by the 
Department, petitioner began treatment for the disease. 
The treatment, which would take a year to complete, in
volved weekly self-injections of medication by use of a sy [CITE_END:DOC007[P002.B06]]

[CITE_START:DOC007[P003.B02]] ringe. Soon after petitioner began this treatment, prison 
ofﬁcials were unable to account for one of the syringes made 
available to petitioner (and other prisoners) for medical 
purposes. Upon searching, they found it in a communal 
trash can, modiﬁed in a manner suggestive of use for injec
tion of illegal drugs. Prisoner Complaint in Civ. Action 
No. 05–CV–00405–LTB–MJW (D. Colo.), p. 3 (hereinafter 
Petitioner’s Complaint). [CITE_END:DOC007[P003.B02]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P003.B03]] Prison ofﬁcials, disbelieving petitioner’s claim not to have taken the syringe, found that his conduct constituted a vio lation of the Colorado Code of Penal Discipline for possession of drug paraphernalia. Letter from Anthony A. DeCesaro to William Erickson (Sept. 30, 2004), attached to Petitioner’s Complaint. This conduct, according to the ofﬁcials, led to the “reasonable inference” that petitioner had intended to use drugs, so the ofﬁcials removed petitioner from his hepati tis C treatment. Ibid. “The successful treatment of Hepa titis C is incumbent upon the individual remaining drug and alcohol free to give the liver a better chance [CITE_END:DOC007[P003.B03]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P003.B04]] of recovery,” they indicated, ibid., an explanation they later offered to de fend against petitioner’s allegations of cruel and unusual punishment, see Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss in Civ. Ac tion No. 05–CV–00405–LTB–MJW, p. 10. Assuming that a person in the course of this treatment takes illicit drugs, the prison’s protocol mandates a waiting period of one year followed by a mandatory drug education class lasting six months. Brief in Opposition 4. Petitioner therefore could face a delay of some 18 months before he would be able to restart treatment. [CITE_END:DOC007[P003.B04]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P003.B05]] In his complaint petitioner alleged Dr. Bloor had “removed 
[him] from [his] hepatitis C treatment” in violation of Depart
ment protocol, “thus endangering [his] life.” Petitioner’s 
Complaint 2. Petitioner attached to the complaint certain 
grievance forms. In these he claimed, among other things, 
he was suffering from “continued damage to [his] liver” as a 
result of the nontreatment. Colorado Dept. of Corrections [CITE_END:DOC007[P003.B05]]

[CITE_START:DOC007[P004.B03]] Offender Grievance Form (June 30, 2004). The complaint 
requested relief including damages and an injunction requir
ing that the Department treat petitioner for hepatitis C 
“under the standards of the treatment [protocol] established 
by [the Department].” Petitioner’s Complaint 8. [CITE_END:DOC007[P004.B03]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P004.B04]] Three months after ﬁling his complaint, and well before the District Court entered a judgment against him, peti tioner ﬁled a Motion for Expedited Review Due to Imminent Danger in Civ. Action No. 05–B–405 (MJW) (D. Colo.). Indi cating it was “undisputed” that he had hepatitis C, that he met the Department’s standards for treatment of the disease, and that “furtherance of this disease can cause irreversible damage to [his] liver and possible death,” petitioner alleged that “numerous inmates” in his prison community had died of the disease and that he was “in imminent danger” himself “due to [the Department’s] [CITE_END:DOC007[P004.B04]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P004.B05]] refusal to treat him.” Ibid. He had identiﬁed similar allegations in an earlier ﬁling, explain ing that “his liver is suffering irreversible damage” due to the decision to remove him from treatment and that he “will suffer irreparable damage if his disease goes untreated.” Plaintiff’s Objections to the Magistrate’s Recommendations in Civ. Action No. 05–CV–00405–LTB–MJW (Feb. 27, 2005), p. 3. [CITE_END:DOC007[P004.B05]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P004.B06]] Respondents answered these ﬁlings with a motion to dis
miss. The Magistrate Judge recommended, as relevant, that 
the District Court dismiss the complaint on the ground it 
failed to allege Dr. Bloor’s actions had caused petitioner 
“substantial harm.” Recommendation on Defendants’ Mo
tion to Dismiss (Feb. 9, 2006), p. 12. The District Court 
issued a short order indicating its agreement with the Mag
istrate Judge and dismissing the complaint. [CITE_END:DOC007[P004.B06]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P004.B07]] The Court of Appeals afﬁrmed. It quoted extensively 
from the Magistrate Judge’s discussion of “substantial harm” 
before holding that petitioner had made “only conclusory 
allegations to the effect that he has suffered a cognizable 
independent harm as a result of his removal from the [hep [CITE_END:DOC007[P004.B07]]

[CITE_START:DOC007[P005.B02]] atitis C] treatment program.” 198 Fed. Appx., at 698. Ac knowledging decisions by courts that have found Eighth Amendment violations when delays in medical treatment have involved “life-threatening situations and instances in which it is apparent that delay would exacerbate the prison er’s medical problems” (and that have, moreover, indicated the Eighth Amendment “protects against future harm to an inmate”), id., at 697 (internal quotation marks omitted), the court nevertheless found petitioner’s complaint deﬁcient: Petitioner had, according to the court, failed to “allege that as a result of the discontinuance of the treatment itself shortly after it began or the [CITE_END:DOC007[P005.B02]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P005.B03]] interruption of treatment for approximately eighteen months he suffered any harm, let alone substantial harm, [other] than what he already faced from the Hepatitis C itself,” id., at 698 (internal quotation marks omitted). Having reached this conclusion, the court saw no need to address whether the complaint alleged facts sufﬁcient to support a ﬁnding that Dr. Bloor had made her decisions with a “sufﬁciently culpable state of mind.” Id., at 697, 698 (internal quotation marks omitted). [CITE_END:DOC007[P005.B03]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P005.B04]] It may in the ﬁnal analysis be shown that the District 
Court was correct to grant respondents’ motion to dismiss. 
That is not the issue here, however. It was error for the 
Court of Appeals to conclude that the allegations in question, 
concerning harm caused petitioner by the termination of his 
medication, were too conclusory to establish for pleading 
purposes that petitioner had suffered “a cognizable inde
pendent harm” as a result of his removal from the hepatitis 
C treatment program.  Id., at 698. [CITE_END:DOC007[P005.B04]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P005.B05]] Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) requires only “a 
short and plain statement of the claim showing that the 
pleader is entitled to relief.” Speciﬁc facts are not neces
sary; the statement need only “ ‘give the defendant fair no
tice of what the . . .  claim is and the grounds upon which it 
rests.’ ”  Bell Atlantic Corp. v.  Twombly, 550 U. S. 544, 555 
(2007) (quoting  Conley v.  Gibson, 355 U. S. 41, 47 (1957)). In [CITE_END:DOC007[P005.B05]]

[CITE_START:DOC007[P006.B03]] addition, when ruling on a defendant’s motion to dismiss, a 
judge must accept as true all of the factual allegations con
tained in the complaint.  Bell Atlantic Corp., supra, at 555– 
556 (citing  Swierkiewicz v.  Sorema N. A., 534 U. S. 506, 508, 
n. 1 (2002);  Neitzke v.  Williams, 490 U. S. 319, 327 (1989); 
Scheuer v.  Rhodes, 416 U. S. 232, 236 (1974)). [CITE_END:DOC007[P006.B03]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P006.B04]] The complaint stated that Dr. Bloor’s decision to remove 
petitioner from his prescribed hepatitis C medication was 
“endangering [his] life.” Petitioner’s Complaint 2. It al
leged this medication was withheld “shortly after” petitioner 
had commenced a treatment program that would take one 
year, that he was “still in need of treatment for this disease,” 
and that the prison ofﬁcials were in the meantime refusing 
to provide treatment.  Id., at 3, 4. This alone was enough 
to satisfy Rule 8(a)(2). Petitioner, in addition, bolstered his 
claim by making more speciﬁc allegations in documents 
attached to the complaint and in later ﬁlings. [CITE_END:DOC007[P006.B04]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P006.B05]] The Court of Appeals’ departure from the liberal pleading 
standards set forth by Rule 8(a)(2) is even more pronounced 
in this particular case because petitioner has been proceed
ing, from the litigation’s outset, without counsel. A docu
ment ﬁled  pro se is “to be liberally construed,”  Estelle, 429 
U. S., at 106, and “a  pro se complaint, however inartfully 
pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal 
pleadings drafted by lawyers,”  ibid. (internal quotation 
marks omitted). Cf. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(f) (“All pleadings 
shall be so construed as to do substantial justice”). [CITE_END:DOC007[P006.B05]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P006.B06]] Whether petitioner’s complaint is sufﬁcient in all respects 
is a matter yet to be determined, for respondents raised mul
tiple arguments in their motion to dismiss. In particular, 
the proper application of the controlling legal principles to 
the facts is yet to be determined. The case cannot, however, 
be dismissed on the ground that petitioner’s allegations of 
harm were too conclusory to put these matters in issue. 
Certiorari and leave to proceed  in forma pauperis are 
granted, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, [CITE_END:DOC007[P006.B06]]

[CITE_START:DOC007[P007.B04]] Justice Scalia would deny the petition for a writ of certiorari. Justice Thomas, dissenting. I have repeatedly stated that the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment historically concerned only injuries relating to a criminal sentence. Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.
