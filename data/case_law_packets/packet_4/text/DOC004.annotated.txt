The panel held that the complaint did not meet the pleading

GOULD, Circuit Judge: We consider whether Plaintiffs-Appellants have pleaded facts sufficient under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 8(a) and 9(b) to support a plausible theory of Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”) and RICO conspiracy violations against Defendants-Appellees. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, and we hold that Plaintiffs’ complaint does not meet the pleading standards required by Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544 (2007); Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662 (2009); Starr v. Baca , 652 F.3d 1202 (9th Cir. 2011); and In re Century Aluminum Co. Securities Litigation , 729 F.3d

1104 (9th Cir. 2013). The complaint does not contain adequate factual allegations to plausibly infer that Defendants specifically intended to defraud, and therefore does not show a plausible entitlement to relief. 1 The district court did not err in dismissing Plaintiffs’ complaint on the pleadings.

entities placed Church’s Chicken franchises on theirs. 2   The
Morabito and Waelti entities executed sale-leaseback
transactions with Sovereign Investment Company or a related
entity, 3  becoming tenants on the real estate that they had
purchased.  According to Plaintiffs, the fair market value of
the 22 commercial real estate properties was not $20.3
million, but $11.1 million.

Other Jiffy Lube leases were held by Defendants New York Seven Lube LLC, New York Lube Number 3, LLC, and Rochester Lube, LLC. These Defendants are alleged to have been controlled by Morabito.

Plaintiffs purchased all of the properties in a series of independent transactions for a combined $30.3 million in 2004, 2005, and 2006. The Morabito and Waelti entities at first performed on their leases, some for up to four years, making a total of about $8.1 million in rent payments to Plaintiffs.

RICO conspiracies, along with related state common law and
statutory claims.  The district court dismissed the case under
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), concluding that
Plaintiffs had not met their burden under Rules 8(a) and 9(b)

Rule 8 requires a complaint to include “a short and plain
statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to
relief.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).  To meet this requirement, the
Supreme Court has held that an “entitlement to relief”
requires “more than labels and conclusions . . . .  Factual
allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above a
speculative level.”   Twombly , 550 U.S. at 555.  Although “a
well-pleaded complaint may proceed even if it strikes a savvy
judge that actual proof is improbable,”  id.  at 556, plaintiffs
must include sufficient “factual enhancement” to cross “the
line between possibility and plausibility.”   Id.  at 557. 5   This

5  Rule 9(b) requires that “circumstances constituting fraud” must be
alleged with particularity but allows fraudulent intent to be alleged
generally.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b).  We have held that the
plausibility analysis of  Twombly  and  Iqbal  applies equally to Rule 9 as it
does to Rule 8.   Cafasso v. Gen. Dynamics C4 Sys., Inc ., 637 F.3d 1047,
1055 (9th Cir. 2011).  Accordingly, although the language of Rule 9 poses
no barrier in itself to general pleading of fraudulent intent,  Twombly  and
Iqbal ’s pleading standards must still be applied to test complaints that
contain claims of fraud.

12 standard represents a balance between Rule 8’s roots in
relatively liberal notice pleading and the need to prevent “a
plaintiff with a largely groundless claim” from “‘tak[ing] up
the time of a number of other people, with the right to do so
representing an  in terrorem  increment of settlement value.’” 
Id.  at 557–58 (quoting  Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Broudo ,
544 U.S. 336, 347 (2005)).
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC004.P012.B02">
Establishing the plausibility of a complaint’s allegations is a two-step process that is “context-specific” and “requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.” Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 679. First, a court should “identif[y] pleadings that, because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth.” Id. Then, a court should “assume the[] veracity” of “well pleaded factual allegations” and “determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.” Id. “Where a complaint pleads facts that are merely consistent with a defendant’s liability, it stops short of the
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC004.P012.B03">
line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.” Id. at 678 (citation omitted). When considering plausibility, courts must also consider an “obvious alternative explanation” for defendant’s behavior. Id. at 682 (quoting Twombly , 550 U.S. at 567).
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC004.P012.B04">
We have applied  Twombly  and  Iqbal ’s plausibility
standard in two recent cases.  In  Starr v. Baca , 652 F.3d 1202
(9th Cir. 2011), we analyzed the apparent shift in the
Supreme Court’s analysis of Rule 8 pleading standards,
comparing the “more demanding”  Twombly  and  Iqbal
standard to the “more lenient” rule applied in  Swierkiewicz v.
Sorema, N.A. , 534 U.S. 506 (2002) and  Erickson v. Pardus ,
551 U.S. 89 (2007) (per curiam).   Starr , 652 F.3d at 1216. 
We noted that in  Swierkiewicz , the Supreme Court held that
“Rule 8(a) establishes a pleading standard without regard to
</BLOCK>

[Page 13]
<BLOCK id="DOC004.P013.B01">
E CLECTIC P ROPS . E AST V . M ARCUS & M ILLICHAP C O . 13 whether a claim will succeed on the merits. Indeed, it may appear on the face of the pleadings that a recovery is very remote and unlikely but that is not the test.” Starr , 652 F.3d at 1215 (quoting Swierkewicz , 534 U.S. at 514–15). Similarly, we recognized that in Erickson , the Supreme Court reversed our sister circuit’s determination that a complaint was overly conclusory and held that a relatively sparse complaint satisfied Rule 8(a)’s pleading standards. Starr , 652 F.3d
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC004.P013.B02">
at 1215 (citing Erickson , 551 U.S. at 94). Despite a potential conflict between the two groups of cases, we concluded that the Supreme Court’s precedents established the following principles:
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC004.P013.B03">
First, to be entitled to the presumption of
truth, allegations in a complaint or
counterclaim may not simply recite the
elements of a cause of action, but must
contain sufficient allegations of underlying
facts to give fair notice and to enable the
opposing party to defend itself effectively.
Second, the factual allegations that are taken
as true must plausibly suggest an entitlement
to relief, such that it is not unfair to require
the opposing party to be subjected to the
expense of discovery and continued litigation.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC004.P013.B04">
Starr , 652 F.3d at 1216.  We applied these principles to hold: 
“If there are two alternative explanations, one advanced by
defendant and the other advanced by plaintiff, both of which
are plausible, plaintiff’s complaint survives a motion to
dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).  Plaintiff's complaint may be
dismissed only when defendant’s plausible alternative
explanation is so convincing that plaintiff's explanation is
im plausible.”   Id.  (emphasis in original).

E CLECTIC P ROPS . E AST V . M ARCUS & M ILLICHAP C O . 14 A more recent examination of Rule 8(a) confronted the application of the plausibility standard to a complaint with less factual support than that in Starr . In re Century Aluminum Co. Secs. Litig. , 729 F.3d 1104 (9th Cir. 2013). We affirmed the dismissal of the complaint in Century because, “[w]hen faced with two possible explanations, only one of which can be true and only one of which results in liability, plaintiffs cannot offer allegations that are merely consistent with their favored

Something more is needed, such as facts tending to exclude the possibility that the alternative explanation is true, in order to render plaintiffs’ allegations plausible.” 729 F.3d at 1108 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted) (quoting Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678; citing Twombly , 550 U.S. at 554). Unlike Starr , where the plaintiff’s plausible complaint survived a motion to dismiss by offering facts that tended to exclude the defendant’s innocuous alternative explanation, we held that the complaint in Century established only a “possible” entitlement to relief, and thus could

In addition, the conduct must be (5) the proximate cause of harm to the victim. Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., Inc. , 473 U.S. 479, 496-97 (1985).

has (A) a common purpose, (B) a structure or organization, and (C) longevity necessary to accomplish the purpose. Boyle v. United States , 556 U.S. 938, 946 (2009). Racketeering activity, the fourth element, requires predicate acts, which in this case are alleged to be mail and wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 and 1343. The mail and wire fraud statutes are identical except for the particular method used to disseminate the fraud, and contain three elements: (A) the formation of a scheme to defraud, (B) the use of the mails or wires in furtherance of that scheme, and (C)

the specific intent to defraud. Schreiber Distrib. Co. v. Serv-Well Furniture Co., Inc. , 806 F.2d 1393, 1399 (9th Cir. 1986). It is this final sub-element, the defendant’s specific intent to defraud, that is at issue here.

“In order to prove a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1341, there

party asserting fraud must first prove “the existence of a

examining the scheme itself” the court may infer a
defendant’s specific intent to defraud.   United States v.

Plaintiffs’ fraud theory requires them to show more than a business deal gone bad for economic and non-fraudulent reasons. They must establish that Defendants had the specific intent to defraud, and Plaintiffs may establish that intent by showing the existence of a plausible fraudulent scheme. “The level of factual specificity needed to satisfy this pleading requirement will vary depending on the context.” Century , 729 F.3d at 1107 (citing Robbins v. Oklahoma , 519 F.3d 1242, 1248 (10th Cir. 2008)).

We proceed in our analysis by removing conclusory statements of law from the complaint. Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 679. Trimmed of “legal conclusions” and “threadbare recitals of a cause of action,” Id. at 678, Plaintiffs’ argument that the alleged scheme reflects an intent to defraud contains two prongs. First, Plaintiffs point to the rapid increase in the price of the properties from the alleged “true market value” at the time of the Morabito or Waelti entities’ initial purchase to the prices at the time that the properties were sold to Plaintiffs, and the Plaintiffs’ subsequent inability to sell the

The key factual allegation that supports Plaintiffs’ first
argument is that Defendants sold property worth $11.1
million to Plaintiffs for $30.3 million while spending $8.1
million on rent to maintain the alleged scheme until all
properties were sold.  We conclude that this allegation does
not create a plausible entitlement to relief for two reasons.

First, although the increase in price is consistent with Defendants’ alleged fraudulent intent, it does not tend to exclude a plausible and innocuous alternative explanation. See Century , 729 F.3d at 1108. The alternative explanation in this case comes from Plaintiffs’ own complaint: they allege that long-term commercial real estate leases typically support future property sales “at a multiple of the actual market value.” Although the increase here appears large—nearly three times the alleged original true value—Plaintiffs plead no facts that would tend to show that this increase was not typical, appropriate, or the product of legitimate market forces.

relying on our “judicial experience and common sense,” Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 679, we note that real estate values can be variable, and that fluctuations in prices over a period of years are not necessarily unusual, nor are they conclusive proof of wrong-doing, as changes may reflect market conditions. This is particularly true when, as here, the culminating events that harmed Plaintiffs took place in the midst of a deep national recession that seriously affected the

Second, the complaint alleges no specific facts supporting its conclusion that the properties’ “true fair market valu[e]” was just $11.1 million. The complaint does not cite any documents or sources for this value, nor does it explain the methodology by which this value was derived. Further, Plaintiffs’ complaint alleges that Defendants had purchased the properties from independent third parties (not alleged to be a part of the conspiracy or named as defendants in this case) for about $20.3 million.

specific intent to defraud, Plaintiffs’ complaint alleges facts that

specifically intended to defraud, not a “plausible” one.   See Century ,

Plaintiffs also contend that we can infer Defendants’
specific intent to defraud from the fact that Defendants
allegedly concealed the risky nature of the real estate
investments.  Plaintiffs contend that their argument that
Defendants concealed the risks is supported by the allegation
of three sets of facts: 1) that the tenants had not been rated by
credit agencies, 2) that Defendants were aware of this, and
3) that Defendants described the investments as “safe and
secure” or other similar assertions.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC004.P020.B04">
But these facts do not allow us to make the Plaintiffs’ preferred inference that Defendants had the necessary specific intent to defraud Plaintiffs. First, the statements by Defendants about the relative security of the investments constitute “puffing” or related expressions of opinion that are common in sales and not actionable as fraud. See United States v. Gay , 967 F.2d 322, 328–29 (9th Cir. 1992). Second, for this kind of behavior to support a claim of fraud, Plaintiffs must show “deceitful concealment of material facts,” Bohonus , 628 F.2d at 1172 (9th Cir. 1980), but the complaint does not allege

The complaint purported to allege intentional fraud in the
