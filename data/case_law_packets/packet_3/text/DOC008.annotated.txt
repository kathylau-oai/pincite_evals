[CITE_START:DOC008[P001.B03]] CLAPPER, DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE, et al. v . AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA et al. certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit No. 11–1025. Argued October 29, 2012—Decided February 26, 2013 Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA), 50 U. S. C. § 1881a, added by the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, per mits the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence to acquire foreign intelligence information by jointly authorizing the surveillance of individuals who are not “United States persons” and are reasonably believed to be located outside the United States. [CITE_END:DOC008[P001.B03]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P001.B04]] Before doing so, the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence normally must obtain the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court’s (FISC) approval. Surveillance under § 1881a is subject to statutory conditions, judicial authorization, congressional supervision, and com pliance with the Fourth Amendment. Respondents—attorneys and human rights, labor, legal, and media organizations—are United States persons who claim that they engage in sensitive international communi cations with individuals who they believe are likely targets of § 1881a surveillance. On the day that the FISA Amendments Act was enacted, they ﬁled suit, seeking a declaration that § 1881a is facially unconstitu tional and [CITE_END:DOC008[P001.B04]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P001.B05]] a permanent injunction against § 1881a-authorized surveil lance. The District Court found that respondents lacked standing, but the Second Circuit reversed, holding that respondents showed (1) an “objectively reasonable likelihood” that their communications will be in tercepted at some time in the future, and (2) that they are suffering present injuries resulting from costly and burdensome measures they take to protect the conﬁdentiality of their international communications from possible § 1881a surveillance. Held : Respondents do not have Article III standing. Pp. 408–422. [CITE_END:DOC008[P001.B05]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P001.B06]] (a) To establish Article III standing, an injury must be “concrete, 
particularized, and actual or imminent; fairly traceable to the challenged 
action; and redressable by a favorable ruling.”  Monsanto Co.  v.  Geert
son Seed Farms , 561 U. S. 139, 149. “[T]hreatened injury must be 
‘ “certainly impending” ’ to constitute injury in fact,” and “[a]llegations 
of possible future injury” are not sufﬁcient.  Whitmore  v.  Arkansas , 
495 U. S. 149, 158. Pp. 408–409. (b) Respondents assert that they have suffered injury in fact that is 
fairly traceable to § 1881a because there is an objectively reasonable [CITE_END:DOC008[P001.B06]]

[CITE_START:DOC008[P002.B02]] likelihood that their communications with their foreign contacts will be intercepted under § 1881a at some point. This argument fails. Ini tially, the Second Circuit’s “objectively reasonable likelihood” standard is inconsistent with this Court’s “threatened injury” requirement. Re spondents’ standing theory also rests on a speculative chain of possibili ties that does not establish that their potential injury is certainly im pending or is fairly traceable to § 1881a. First, it is highly speculative whether the Government will imminently target communications to which respondents are parties. Since respondents, as U. S. persons, cannot be targeted under § 1881a, their theory [CITE_END:DOC008[P002.B02]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P002.B03]] necessarily rests on their assertion that their foreign contacts will be targeted. Yet they have no actual knowledge of the Government’s § 1881a targeting practices. Second, even if respondents could demonstrate that the targeting of their foreign contacts is imminent, they can only speculate as to whether the Government will seek to use § 1881a-authorized surveillance instead of one of the Government’s numerous other surveillance methods, which are not challenged here. Third, even if respondents could show that the Government will seek the FISC’s authorization to target respondents’ foreign contacts under § 1881a, they can only speculate as to whether [CITE_END:DOC008[P002.B03]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P002.B04]] the FISC will authorize the surveillance. This Court is reluctant to endorse standing theories that require guesswork as to how independ ent decisionmakers will exercise their judgment. See, e. g., Whitmore , supra, at 159–160. Fourth, even if the Government were to obtain the FISC’s approval to target respondents’ foreign contacts under § 1881a, it is unclear whether the Government would succeed in acquiring those contacts’ communications. And ﬁfth, even if the Government were to target respondents’ foreign contacts, respondents can only speculate as to whether their own communications with those contacts would be inci dentally acquired. Pp. 410–414. [CITE_END:DOC008[P002.B04]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P002.B05]] (c) Respondents’ alternative argument is also unpersuasive. They claim that they suffer ongoing injuries that are fairly traceable to § 1881a because the risk of § 1881a surveillance requires them to take costly and burdensome measures to protect the conﬁdentiality of their communications. But respondents cannot manufacture standing by choosing to make expenditures based on hypothetical future harm that is not certainly impending. Because they do not face a threat of cer tainly impending interception under § 1881a, their costs are simply the product of their fear of surveillance, which is insufﬁcient to create stand ing. See Laird v. Tatum [CITE_END:DOC008[P002.B05]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P002.B06]] , 408 U. S. 1, 10–15. Accordingly, any on going injuries that respondents are suffering are not fairly traceable to § 1881a. Pp. 415–418. (d) Respondents’ remaining arguments are likewise unavailing. Contrary to their claim, their alleged injuries are not the same kinds of [CITE_END:DOC008[P002.B06]]

And their sugges tion that they should be held to have standing because otherwise the constitutionality of § 1881a will never be adjudicated is both legally and factually incorrect.

401 Opinion of the Court [CITE_END:DOC008[P004.B01]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P004.B02]] Justice Alito delivered the opinion of the Court. Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, 50 U. S. C. § 1881a (2006 ed., Supp. V), allows the Attor ney General and the Director of National Intelligence to ac quire foreign intelligence information by jointly authorizing the surveillance of individuals who are not “United States persons” 1 and are reasonably believed to be located outside the United States. Before doing so, the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence normally must ob tain the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court’s approval. Respondents are United States persons whose work, they [CITE_END:DOC008[P004.B02]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P004.B03]] allege, requires them to engage in sensitive international communications with individuals who they believe are likely targets of surveillance under § 1881a. Respondents seek a declaration that § 1881a is unconstitutional, as well as an in junction against § 1881a-authorized surveillance. The ques tion before us is whether respondents have Article III stand ing to seek this prospective relief. [CITE_END:DOC008[P004.B03]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P004.B04]] Respondents assert that they can establish injury in fact 
because there is an objectively reasonable likelihood that 
their communications will be acquired under § 1881a at some 
point in the future. But respondents’ theory of  future  in
jury is too speculative to satisfy the well-established require
ment that threatened injury must be “certainly impending.”

[CITE_START:DOC008[P005.B03]] to establish that this injury is fairly traceable to § 1881a. 
As an alternative argument, respondents contend that they 
are suffering  present  injury because the risk of § 1881a
authorized surveillance already has forced them to take 
costly and burdensome measures to protect the conﬁdential
ity of their international communications. But respondents 
cannot manufacture standing by choosing to make expendi
tures based on hypothetical future harm that is not certainly 
impending. We therefore hold that respondents lack Article

[CITE_START:DOC008[P005.B05]] In 1978, after years of debate, Congress enacted the For eign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to authorize and regulate certain governmental electronic surveillance of communications for foreign intelligence purposes. See 92 Stat. 1783, 50 U. S. C. § 1801 et seq. ; 1 D. Kris & J. Wilson, National Security Investigations & Prosecutions §§ 3.1, 3.7 (2d ed. 2012) (hereinafter Kris & Wilson). In enacting FISA, Congress legislated against the backdrop of our deci sion in United States v. United States Dist. Court for East ern Dist. of Mich. , 407 U. S. 297 (1972) ( Keith ), in which [CITE_END:DOC008[P005.B05]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P005.B06]] we explained that the standards and procedures that law en forcement ofﬁcials must follow when conducting “surveil lance of ‘ordinary crime’ ” might not be required in the con text of surveillance conducted for domestic national-security purposes. Id. , at 322–323. Although the Keith opinion ex pressly disclaimed any ruling “on the scope of the President’s surveillance power with respect to the activities of foreign powers,” id. , at 308, it implicitly suggested that a special framework for foreign intelligence surveillance might be con stitutionally permissible, see id. , at 322–323. In constructing such a framework for foreign intelligence surveillance, [CITE_END:DOC008[P005.B06]]

[CITE_START:DOC008[P006.B04]] In the wake of the September 11th attacks, President George W. Bush authorized the National Security Agency (NSA) to conduct warrantless wiretapping of telephone and e-mail communications where one party to the communica tion was located outside the United States and a participant in “the call was reasonably believed to be a member or agent of al Qaeda or an afﬁliated terrorist organization,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 403a. See id. , at 263a–265a, 268a, 273a–279a, 292a–293a; American Civil Liberties Union v. NSA , 493 F. 3d 644, 648 (CA6 2007) ( ACLU ) (opinion of Batchelder, J.). In January [CITE_END:DOC008[P006.B04]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P006.B05]] 2007, the FISC issued orders authorizing the Government to target international communications into or out of the United States where there was probable cause to believe that one participant to the communication was a member or agent of al Qaeda or an associated terrorist orga nization.

When Congress enacted the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 (FISA Amendments Act), 122 Stat. 2436, it left much of FISA intact, but it “established a new and independent source of intelligence collection authority, beyond that granted in traditional FISA.” 1 Kris & Wilson § 9:11, at 349–350. As relevant here, § 702 of FISA, 50 U. S. C. § 1881a (2006 ed., Supp. V), which was enacted as part of the FISA Amendments Act, supplements pre-existing FISA authority by creating a [CITE_END:DOC008[P007.B03]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P007.B04]] new framework under which the Government may seek the FISC’s authorization of certain foreign intelli gence surveillance targeting the communications of non-U. S. persons located abroad. Unlike traditional FISA surveil lance, § 1881a does not require the Government to demon strate probable cause that the target of the electronic sur veillance is a foreign power or agent of a foreign power. Compare §§ 1805(a)(2)(A), (a)(2)(B), with §§ 1881a(d)(1), (i)(3)(A); 638 F. 3d 118, 126 (CA2 2011); 1 Kris & Wilson § 16:16, at 584.

Surveillance under § 1881a is subject to statutory conditions, judicial authorization, congressional supervision, and compliance with the Fourth Amendment.

Additionally, acquisitions under § 1881a must comport with

[CITE_START:DOC008[P008.B03]] Section 1881a mandates that the Government obtain the FISC’s approval of “targeting” procedures, “minimization” procedures, and a governmental certiﬁcation regarding pro posed surveillance. §§ 1881a(a), (c)(1), (i)(2), (i)(3). Among other things, the Government’s certiﬁcation must attest that (1) procedures are in place “that have been approved, have been submitted for approval, or will be submitted with the certiﬁcation for approval by the [FISC] that are reasonably designed” to ensure that an acquisition is “limited to tar geting persons reasonably believed to be located outside” the United States; (2) minimization procedures adequately restrict the acquisition, retention, and dissemination of nonpublic information [CITE_END:DOC008[P008.B03]]

[CITE_START:DOC008[P010.B02]] According to respondents, the threat of surveillance will 
compel them to travel abroad in order to have in-person con
versations. In addition, respondents declare that they have 
undertaken “costly and burdensome measures” to protect 
the conﬁdentiality of sensitive communications.  Ibid. [CITE_END:DOC008[P010.B02]]

[CITE_START:DOC008[P010.B04]] On the day when the FISA Amendments Act was enacted, respondents ﬁled this action seeking (1) a declaration that § 1881a, on its face, violates the Fourth Amendment, the First Amendment, Article III, and separation-of-powers principles and (2) a permanent injunction against the use of § 1881a. Respondents assert what they characterize as two separate theories of Article III standing. First, they claim that there is an objectively reasonable likelihood that their communications will be acquired under § 1881a at some point in the future, thus causing them injury. Second, respond ents maintain that the risk of surveillance under § [CITE_END:DOC008[P010.B04]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P010.B05]] 1881a is so substantial that they have been forced to take costly and burdensome measures to protect the conﬁdentiality of their international communications; in their view, the costs they have incurred constitute present injury that is fairly trace able to § 1881a. [CITE_END:DOC008[P010.B05]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P010.B06]] After both parties moved for summary judgment, the Dis trict Court held that respondents do not have standing. 646 F. Supp. 2d, at 635. On appeal, however, a panel of the Sec ond Circuit reversed. The panel agreed with respondents’ argument that they have standing due to the objectively rea sonable likelihood that their communications will be inter cepted at some time in the future. 638 F. 3d, at 133, 134, 139. In addition, the panel held that respondents have es tablished that they are suffering “ present injuries in fact— economic and professional harms—stemming from a reason able fear [CITE_END:DOC008[P010.B06]]

[CITE_START:DOC008[P012.B04]] To establish Article III standing, an injury must be “con crete, particularized, and actual or imminent; fairly traceable to the challenged action; and redressable by a favorable rul ing.” Monsanto Co. v.

[CITE_START:DOC008[P013.B02]] Opinion of the Court III A [CITE_END:DOC008[P013.B02]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P013.B03]] Respondents assert that they can establish injury in fact that is fairly traceable to § 1881a because there is an objec tively reasonable likelihood that their communications with their foreign contacts will be intercepted under § 1881a at some point in the future. This argument fails. As an initial matter, the Second Circuit’s “objectively reasonable likeli hood” standard is inconsistent with our requirement that “threatened injury must be certainly impending to constitute injury in fact.” Whitmore , supra , at 158 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also DaimlerChrysler Corp. , supra , at 345; Laidlaw , supra , at 190; [CITE_END:DOC008[P013.B03]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P013.B04]] Defenders of Wildlife , supra , at 565, n. 2; Babbitt , supra , at 298. Furthermore, respondents’ argument rests on their highly speculative fear that: (1) the Government will decide to target the communications of non- U. S. persons with whom they communicate; (2) in doing so, the Government will choose to invoke its authority under § 1881a rather than utilizing another method of surveillance; (3) the Article III judges who serve on the FISC will con clude that the Government’s proposed surveillance proce dures satisfy § 1881a’s many safeguards and are consistent with the Fourth Amendment; (4) the [CITE_END:DOC008[P013.B04]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P013.B05]] Government will suc ceed in intercepting the communications of respondents’ con tacts; and (5) respondents will be parties to the particular communications that the Government intercepts. As dis cussed below, respondents’ theory of standing, which relies on a highly attenuated chain of possibilities, does not satisfy the requirement that threatened injury must be certainly impending. See Summers , supra , at 496 (rejecting a stand ing theory premised on a speculative chain of possibilities); Whitmore , supra , at 157–160 (same). Moreover, even if respondents could demonstrate injury in fact, the second link in the above-described chain of contingencies—which amounts [CITE_END:DOC008[P013.B05]]

[CITE_START:DOC008[P014.B02]] would be under § 1881a or some other authority—shows that 
respondents cannot satisfy the requirement that any injury 
in fact must be fairly traceable to § 1881a. [CITE_END:DOC008[P014.B02]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P014.B03]] First, it is speculative whether the Government will immi nently target communications to which respondents are par ties. Section 1881a expressly provides that respondents, who are U. S. persons, cannot be targeted for surveillance under § 1881a. See §§ 1881a(b)(1)–(3); 667 F. 3d, at 173 (Raggi, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc). Ac cordingly, it is no surprise that respondents fail to offer any evidence that their communications have been monitored under § 1881a, a failure that substantially undermines their standing theory. See ACLU , 493 F. 3d, at 655–656, 673–674 (opinion of Batchelder, J.) (concluding that plaintiffs [CITE_END:DOC008[P014.B03]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P014.B04]] who lacked evidence that their communications had been inter cepted did not have standing to challenge alleged NSA sur veillance). Indeed, respondents do not even allege that the Government has sought the FISC’s approval for surveillance of their communications. Accordingly, respondents’ theory necessarily rests on their assertion that the Government will target other individuals —namely, their foreign contacts. [CITE_END:DOC008[P014.B04]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P014.B05]] Yet respondents have no actual knowledge of the Govern ment’s § 1881a targeting practices. Instead, respondents merely speculate and make assumptions about whether their communications with their foreign contacts will be acquired under § 1881a. See 667 F. 3d, at 185–187 (opinion of Raggi, J.). For example, journalist Christopher Hedges states: “I have no choice but to assume that any of my international commu nications may be subject to government surveillance, and I have to make decisions . . . in light of that assumption .” App. to Pet. for Cert. 366a (emphasis added and deleted). Similarly, attorney Scott McKay [CITE_END:DOC008[P014.B05]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P014.B06]] asserts that, “[b]ecause of the [FISA Amendments Act], we now have to assume that every one of our international communications may be moni tored by the government.” Id. , at 375a (emphasis added); see also id. , at 337a, 343a–344a, 350a, 356a. “The party in [CITE_END:DOC008[P014.B06]]

[CITE_START:DOC008[P015.B03]] voking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing” standing—and, at the summary judgment stage, such a party “can no longer rest on . . . ‘mere allegations,’ but must ‘set forth’ by afﬁdavit or other evidence ‘speciﬁc facts.’ ” De fenders of Wildlife , 504 U. S., at 561. Respondents, how ever, have set forth no speciﬁc facts demonstrating that the communications of their foreign contacts will be targeted. Moreover, because § 1881a at most authorizes —but does not mandate or direct —the surveillance that respondents fear, respondents’ allegations are necessarily conjectural. See United Presbyterian Church in U. S. A. [CITE_END:DOC008[P015.B03]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P015.B04]] v. Reagan , 738 F. 2d 1375, 1380 (CADC 1984) (Scalia, J.); 667 F. 3d, at 187 (opinion of Raggi, J.). Simply put, respondents can only speculate as to how the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence will exercise their discretion in determining which communications to target. 4 Second, even if respondents could demonstrate that the targeting of their foreign contacts is imminent, respondents can only speculate as to whether the Government will seek to use § 1881a-authorized surveillance (rather than other methods) to do so. The Government has numerous other 4 It was suggested at oral argument [CITE_END:DOC008[P015.B04]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P015.B05]] that the Government could help resolve the standing inquiry by disclosing to a court, perhaps through an in camera proceeding, (1) whether it is intercepting respondents’ commu nications and (2) what targeting or minimization procedures it is using. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 13–14, 44, 56. This suggestion is puzzling. As an initial matter, it is respondents’ burden to prove their standing by pointing to speciﬁc facts, Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife , 504 U. S. 555, 561 (1992), not the Government’s burden to disprove standing by revealing details of its surveillance priorities. Moreover, this type of hypothetical disclosure proceeding [CITE_END:DOC008[P015.B05]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P015.B06]] would allow a terrorist (or his attorney) to determine whether he is currently under U. S. surveillance simply by ﬁling a lawsuit challeng ing the Government’s surveillance program. Even if the terrorist’s attor ney were to comply with a protective order prohibiting him from sharing the Government’s disclosures with his client, the court’s postdisclosure de cision about whether to dismiss the suit for lack of standing would surely signal to the terrorist whether his name was on the list of surveillance targets.

[CITE_START:DOC008[P016.B02]] methods of conducting surveillance, none of which is chal lenged here. Even after the enactment of the FISA Amend ments Act, for example, the Government may still conduct electronic surveillance of persons abroad under the older pro visions of FISA so long as it satisﬁes the applicable require ments, including a demonstration of probable cause to be lieve that the person is a foreign power or agent of a foreign power. See § 1805. The Government may also obtain infor mation from the intelligence services of foreign nations. Brief for Petitioners 33. And, although we do not reach the question, [CITE_END:DOC008[P016.B02]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P016.B03]] the Government contends that it can conduct FISA-exempt human and technical surveillance programs that are governed by Executive Order 12333. See Exec. Order No. 12333, §§ 1.4, 2.1–2.5, 3 CFR 202, 210–212 (1981), reprinted as amended, note following 50 U. S. C. § 401, pp. 543, 547–548. Even if respondents could demonstrate that their foreign contacts will imminently be targeted— indeed, even if they could show that interception of their own communications will imminently occur—they would still need to show that their injury is fairly traceable to § 1881a. But, because respondents can only speculate as to whether any (asserted) [CITE_END:DOC008[P016.B03]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P016.B04]] interception would be under § 1881a or some other authority, they cannot satisfy the “fairly traceable” requirement. [CITE_END:DOC008[P016.B04]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P016.B05]] Third, even if respondents could show that the Govern
ment will seek the FISC’s authorization to acquire the com
munications of respondents’ foreign contacts under § 1881a, 
respondents can only speculate as to whether that court will 
authorize such surveillance. In the past, we have been re
luctant to endorse standing theories that require guesswork 
as to how independent decisionmakers will exercise their 
judgment. In  Whitmore , for example, the plaintiff ’s theory 
of standing hinged largely on the probability that he would 
obtain federal habeas relief and be convicted upon retrial. 
In holding that the plaintiff lacked standing, we explained 
that “[i]t is just not possible for a litigant to prove in advance [CITE_END:DOC008[P016.B05]]

supra , at 562. [CITE_END:DOC008[P017.B03]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P017.B04]] We decline to abandon our usual reluctance to endorse standing theories that rest on speculation about the de cisions of independent actors. Section 1881a mandates that the Government must obtain the FISC’s approval of targeting procedures, minimization procedures, and a gov ernmental certification regarding proposed surveillance. §§ 1881a(a), (c)(1), (i)(2), (i)(3). The court must, for example, determine whether the Government’s procedures are “rea sonably designed . . . to minimize the acquisition and re tention, and prohibit the dissemination, of nonpublicly avail able information concerning unconsenting United States persons.” § 1801(h); see §§ 1881a(i)(2), (i)(3)(A). And, criti cally, the court [CITE_END:DOC008[P017.B04]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P017.B05]] must also assess whether the Government’s targeting and minimization procedures comport with the Fourth Amendment. § 1881a(i)(3)(A). [CITE_END:DOC008[P017.B05]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P017.B06]] Fourth, even if the Government were to obtain the FISC’s 
approval to target respondents’ foreign contacts under 
§ 1881a, it is unclear whether the Government would succeed 
in acquiring the communications of respondents’ foreign con
tacts. And ﬁfth, even if the Government were to conduct 
surveillance of respondents’ foreign contacts, respondents 
can only speculate as to whether  their own communications 
with their foreign contacts would be incidentally acquired. [CITE_END:DOC008[P017.B06]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P017.B07]] In sum, respondents’ speculative chain of possibilities does not establish that injury based on potential future surveil lance is certainly impending or is fairly traceable to § 1881a. 5 5 Our cases do not uniformly require plaintiffs to demonstrate that it is literally certain that the harms they identify will come about. In some instances, we have found standing based on a “substantial risk” that the harm will occur, which may prompt plaintiffs to reasonably incur costs to mitigate or avoid that harm. Monsanto Co. v. Geertson Seed Farms , 561 U. S. 139, 153 (2010). See also Pennell v. [CITE_END:DOC008[P017.B07]]

[CITE_START:DOC008[P018.B02]] Respondents’ alternative argument—namely, that they can establish standing based on the measures that they have undertaken to avoid § 1881a-authorized surveillance—fares no better. Respondents assert that they are suffering ongo ing injuries that are fairly traceable to § 1881a because the risk of surveillance under § 1881a requires them to take costly and burdensome measures to protect the conﬁdential ity of their communications. Respondents claim, for in stance, that the threat of surveillance sometimes compels them to avoid certain e-mail and phone conversations, to “tal[k] in generalities rather than speciﬁcs,” or to travel so that they can have in-person conversations.

See 638 F. 3d, at 133–134; 667 F. 3d, at 180 (opin ion of Raggi, J.). Analyzing the “fairly traceable” element of standing under a relaxed reasonableness standard, see 638 F. 3d, at 133–134, the Second Circuit then held that “plaintiffs requirement, respondents fall short of [CITE_END:DOC008[P018.B03]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P018.B04]] even that standard, in light of the attenuated chain of inferences necessary to ﬁnd harm here. See supra, at 411–414. In addition, plaintiffs bear the burden of pleading and proving concrete facts showing that the defendant’s actual action has caused the substantial risk of harm. Plaintiffs cannot rely on speculation about “ ‘the unfettered choices made by independent actors not before the courts.’ ” Defenders of Wildlife , 504 U. S., at 562. [CITE_END:DOC008[P018.B04]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P018.B05]] 6  For all the focus on respondents’ supposed need to travel abroad in 
light of potential § 1881a surveillance, respondents cite only one speciﬁc 
instance of travel: an attorney’s trip to New York City to meet with other 
lawyers. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 352a. This domestic travel had but 
a tenuous connection to § 1881a, because § 1881a-authorized acquisitions 
“may not intentionally target any person known at the time of acquisition 
to be located in the United States.” § 1881a(b)(1); see also 667 F. 3d 163,

Respondents’ contention that they have standing because they incurred certain costs as a reasonable reaction to a risk of harm is unavailing—because the harm respondents seek to avoid is not certainly impending. In other words, re spondents cannot manufacture standing merely by inﬂicting [CITE_END:DOC008[P019.B04]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P019.B05]] harm on themselves based on their fears of hypothetical fu ture harm that is not certainly impending. See Pennsylva nia v. New Jersey , 426 U. S. 660, 664 (1976) ( per curiam ); National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Assn. , Inc . v. Gonzales , 468 F. 3d 826, 831 (CADC 2006). Any ongo ing injuries that respondents are suffering are not fairly traceable to § 1881a. [CITE_END:DOC008[P019.B05]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P019.B06]] If the law were otherwise, an enterprising plaintiff would be able to secure a lower standard for Article III standing simply by making an expenditure based on a nonparanoid fear. As Judge Raggi accurately noted, under the Second Circuit panel’s reasoning, respondents could, “for the price of a plane ticket, . . . transform their standing burden from one requiring a showing of actual or imminent . . . intercep tion to one requiring a showing that their subjective fear of such interception is not fanciful, irrational, or clearly unrea sonable.” 667 F. 3d, at 180 (internal quotation marks omit [CITE_END:DOC008[P019.B06]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P019.B07]] ted). Thus, allowing respondents to bring this action based on costs they incurred in response to a speculative threat would be tantamount to accepting a repackaged version of respondents’ ﬁrst failed theory of standing. See ACLU , 493 F. 3d, at 656–657 (opinion of Batchelder, J.). [CITE_END:DOC008[P019.B07]]

[CITE_START:DOC008[P020.B02]] Another reason that respondents’ present injuries are not fairly traceable to § 1881a is that even before § 1881a was enacted, they had a similar incentive to engage in many of the countermeasures that they are now taking. See id., at 668–670. For instance, respondent Scott McKay’s decla ration describes—and the dissent heavily relies on—McKay’s “knowledge” that thousands of communications involving one of his clients were monitored in the past. App. to Pet. for Cert. 370a; post, at 425–426, 429. But this surveillance was conducted pursuant to FISA authority that predated § 1881a. See Brief for Petitioners 32, n. 11; [CITE_END:DOC008[P020.B02]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P020.B03]] Al-Kidd v. Gonzales , No. 05–cv–93, 2008 WL 5123009 (D Idaho, Dec. 4, 2008). Thus, because the Government was allegedly conducting surveil lance of McKay’s client before Congress enacted § 1881a, it is difﬁcult to see how the safeguards that McKay now claims to have implemented can be traced to § 1881a. [CITE_END:DOC008[P020.B03]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P020.B04]] Because respondents do not face a threat of certainly im pending interception under § 1881a, the costs that they have incurred to avoid surveillance are simply the product of their fear of surveillance, 7 and our decision in Laird makes it clear that such a fear is insufﬁcient to create standing. See 408 U. S., at 10–15. The plaintiffs in Laird argued that their exercise of First Amendment rights was being “chilled by the mere existence, without more, of [the Army’s] investiga tive and data-gathering activity.” Id. , at 10. While ac knowledging that prior cases had held that constitutional [CITE_END:DOC008[P020.B04]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P020.B05]] vi olations may arise from the chilling effect of “regulations that fall short of a direct prohibition against the exercise of 7 Although respondents’ alternative theory of standing rests primarily on choices that they have made based on their subjective fear of surveil lance, respondents also assert that third parties might be disinclined to speak with them due to a fear of surveillance. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 372a–373a, 352a–353a. To the extent that such assertions are based on anything other than conjecture, see Defenders of Wildlife , 504 U. S., at 560, they do not establish injury that [CITE_END:DOC008[P020.B05]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P020.B06]] is fairly traceable to § 1881a, because they are based on third parties’ subjective fear of surveillance, see Laird v. Tatum , 408 U. S. 1, 10–14 (1972). [CITE_END:DOC008[P020.B06]]

Because “[a]llegations of a subjective ‘chill’ are not an adequate sub stitute for a claim of speciﬁc present objective harm or a threat of speciﬁc future harm,” id. , at 13–14, the plaintiffs in Laird [CITE_END:DOC008[P021.B03]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P021.B04]] —and respondents here—lack standing. See ibid. ; ACLU , supra , at 661–662 (opinion of Batchelder, J.) (holding that plaintiffs lacked standing because they “allege[d] only a subjective apprehension” of alleged NSA surveillance and “a personal (self-imposed) unwillingness to communicate”); United Presbyterian Church , 738 F. 2d, at 1378 (holding that plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the legality of an Ex ecutive Order relating to surveillance because “the ‘chilling effect’ which is produced by their fear of being subjected to illegal surveillance and which deters them from conducting constitutionally protected activities, is foreclosed as a basis for standing” by Laird [CITE_END:DOC008[P021.B04]]

[CITE_START:DOC008[P022.B02]] 465 (1987), and  Monsanto.  Brief for Respondents 24. As 
an initial matter, none of these cases holds or even suggests 
that plaintiffs can establish standing simply by claiming that 
they experienced a “chilling effect” that resulted from a gov
ernmental policy that does not regulate, constrain, or compel 
any action on their part. Moreover, each of these cases was 
very different from the present case. [CITE_END:DOC008[P022.B02]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P022.B03]] In Laidlaw , plaintiffs’ standing was based on “the proposi tion that a company’s continuous and pervasive illegal dis charges of pollutants into a river would cause nearby resi dents to curtail their recreational use of that waterway and would subject them to other economic and aesthetic harms.” 528 U. S., at 184. Because the unlawful discharges of pollut ants were “concededly ongoing,” the only issue was whether “nearby residents”—who were members of the organiza tional plaintiffs—acted reasonably in refraining from using the polluted area. Id. , at 183–184. Laidlaw is therefore quite unlike the present case, in which it [CITE_END:DOC008[P022.B03]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P022.B04]] is not “concede[d]” that respondents would be subject to unlawful surveillance but for their decision to take preventive measures. See ACLU , 493 F. 3d, at 686 (opinion of Batchelder, J.) (distin guishing Laidlaw on this ground); id. , at 689–690 (Gibbons, J., concurring) (same); 667 F. 3d, at 182–183 (opinion of Raggi, J.) (same). Laidlaw would resemble this case only if (1) it were undisputed that the Government was using § 1881a authorized surveillance to acquire respondents’ communica tions and (2) the sole dispute concerned the reasonableness of respondents’ preventive measures. [CITE_END:DOC008[P022.B04]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P022.B05]] In  Keene , the plaintiff challenged the constitutionality of 
the Government’s decision to label three ﬁlms as “political 
propaganda.” 481 U. S., at 467. The Court held that the 
plaintiff, who was an attorney and a state legislator, had 
standing because he demonstrated, through “detailed afﬁda
vits,” that he “could not exhibit the ﬁlms without incurring 
a risk of injury to his reputation and of an impairment of his [CITE_END:DOC008[P022.B05]]

case,  Keene  involved “more than a ‘subjective chill’ ” based 
on speculation about potential governmental action; the

relevant statute, and the ﬁlms that he wished to exhibit had

[CITE_START:DOC008[P023.B04]] Monsanto , on which respondents also rely, is likewise in- apposite. In Monsanto , conventional alfalfa farmers had standing to seek injunctive relief because the agency’s decision to deregulate a variety of genetically engineered alfalfa gave rise to a “signiﬁcant risk of gene ﬂow to non-genetically-engineered varieties of alfalfa.” 561 U. S., at 155. The standing analysis in that case hinged on evi dence that genetically engineered alfalfa “ ‘seed ﬁelds [we]re currently being planted in all the major alfalfa seed produc tion areas’ ”; the bees that pollinate alfalfa “ ‘have a range of at least two to ten [CITE_END:DOC008[P023.B04]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P023.B05]] miles’ ”; and the alfalfa seed farms were concentrated in an area well within the bees’ pollination range. Id. , at 154, and n. 3. Unlike the conventional alfalfa farmers in Monsanto , however, respondents in the present case present no concrete evidence to substantiate their fears, but instead rest on mere conjecture about possible govern mental actions.

to “insulate the government’s surveillance activities from 
meaningful judicial review.” Brief for Respondents 60.

joined by G insburg , J., concurring in judgment). Second, our holding today by no means insulates § 1881a 
from judicial review. As described above, Congress created 
a comprehensive scheme in which the FISC evaluates the 
Government’s certiﬁcations, targeting procedures, and mini
mization procedures—including assessing whether the tar
geting and minimization procedures comport with the 
Fourth Amendment. §§ 1881a(a), (c)(1), (i)(2), (i)(3). Any 
dissatisfaction that respondents may have about the FISC’s 
rulings—or the congressional delineation of that court’s 
role—is irrelevant to our standing analysis. [CITE_END:DOC008[P024.B02]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P024.B03]] Additionally, if the Government intends to use or disclose information obtained or derived from a § 1881a acquisition in judicial or administrative proceedings, it must provide advance notice of its intent, and the affected person may challenge the lawfulness of the acquisition. §§ 1806(c), (e), 1881e(a) (2006 ed. and Supp. V). 8 Thus, if the Government were to prosecute one of respondent-attorney’s foreign cli ents using § 1881a-authorized surveillance, the Government would be required to make a disclosure. Although the for eign client might not have a viable Fourth Amendment claim, see, e. g. , United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez , [CITE_END:DOC008[P024.B03]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P024.B04]] 494 U. S. 259, 261 (1990), it is possible that the monitoring of the tar get’s conversations with his or her attorney would provide grounds for a claim of standing on the part of the attorney. Such an attorney would certainly have a stronger eviden tiary basis for establishing standing than do respondents in the present case. In such a situation, unlike in the pres 8 The possibility of judicial review in this context is not farfetched. In United States v. Damrah , 412 F. 3d 618 (CA6 2005), for example, the Gov ernment made a pretrial disclosure that it [CITE_END:DOC008[P024.B04]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P024.B05]] intended to use FISA evidence in a prosecution; the defendant (unsuccessfully) moved to suppress the FISA evidence, even though he had not been the target of the surveillance; and the Sixth Circuit ultimately held that FISA’s procedures are consist ent with the Fourth Amendment.

[CITE_START:DOC008[P025.B03]] ent case, it would at least be clear that the Government 
had acquired the foreign client’s communications using 
§ 1881a-authorized surveillance. Finally, any electronic communications service provider 
that the Government directs to assist in § 1881a surveillance 
may challenge the lawfulness of that directive before the 
FISC. §§ 1881a(h)(4), (h)(6). Indeed, at the behest of a 
service provider, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court 
of Review previously analyzed the constitutionality of elec
tronic surveillance directives issued pursuant to a now-
expired set of FISA amendments. See  In re Directives 
Pursuant to Section 105B of Foreign Intelligence Surveil
lance Act , 551 F. 3d 1004, 1006–1016 (2008) (holding that

constitutional). [CITE_END:DOC008[P025.B03]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P025.B04]] We hold that respondents lack Article III standing because 
they cannot demonstrate that the future injury they purport

§ 1881a (2006 ed., Supp. V), will harm them by intercepting 
at least some of their private, foreign, telephone, or e-mail 
conversations. In my view, this harm is not “speculative.”

[CITE_START:DOC008[P026.B08]] No one here denies that the Government’s interception of

[CITE_START:DOC008[P027.B05]] Since the plaintiffs fear interceptions of a kind authorized by § 1881a, it is important to understand just what kind of surveillance that section authorizes. Congress enacted § 1881a in 2008, as an amendment to the pre-existing Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, 50 U. S. C. § 1801 et seq . Before the amendment, the Act authorized the Government (acting within the United States) to monitor private elec tronic communications between the United States and a for eign country if (1) the Government’s purpose was, in signiﬁ cant part, to obtain foreign intelligence information (which includes information concerning a [CITE_END:DOC008[P027.B05]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P027.B06]] “foreign power” or “terri tory” related to our “national defense” or “security” or the “conduct of . . . foreign affairs”), (2) the Government’s sur veillance target was “a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power,” and (3) the Government used surveillance proce dures designed to “minimize the acquisition and retention, and prohibit the dissemination, of” any private information acquired about Americans. §§ 1801(e), (h), 1804(a). [CITE_END:DOC008[P027.B06]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P027.B07]] In addition, the Government had to obtain the approval of 
the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. To do so, it 
had to submit an application describing (1) each “speciﬁc tar
get,” (2) the “nature of the information sought,” and (3) the 
“type of communications or activities to be subjected to 
the surveillance.” § 1804(a). It had to certify that, in sig
niﬁcant part, it sought to obtain foreign intelligence in
formation.  Ibid.  It had to demonstrate probable cause to 
believe that each speciﬁc target was “a foreign power or 
an agent of a foreign power.” §§ 1804(a), 1805(a). It also 
had to describe instance-speciﬁc procedures to be used to 
minimize intrusions upon Americans’ privacy (compliance [CITE_END:DOC008[P027.B07]]

First, it eliminated the requirement that the Government describe to the court each speciﬁc tar get and identify each facility at which its surveillance would be directed, thus permitting surveillance on a programmatic, not necessarily individualized, basis. § 1881a(g). Second, it eliminated the requirement that a target be a “foreign power or an agent of a foreign power.” Ibid . Third, it diminished the court’s authority to insist upon, and eliminated its au thority to [CITE_END:DOC008[P028.B02]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P028.B03]] supervise, instance-speciﬁc privacy-intrusion mini mization procedures (though the Government still must use court-approved general minimization procedures). § 1881a(e). Thus, using the authority of § 1881a, the Govern ment can obtain court approval for its surveillance of elec tronic communications between places within the United States and targets in foreign territories by showing the court (1) that “a signiﬁcant purpose of the acquisition is to obtain foreign intelligence information,” and (2) that it will use general targeting and privacy-intrusion minimization procedures of a kind that the court had previously ap proved. § 1881a(g).

at 334a–375a. [CITE_END:DOC008[P030.B02]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P030.B03]] III [CITE_END:DOC008[P030.B03]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P030.B04]] Several considerations, based upon the record along with commonsense inferences, convince me that there is a very high likelihood that the Government, acting under the au thority of § 1881a , will intercept at least some of the commu nications just described. First, the plaintiffs have engaged, and continue to engage, in electronic communications of a kind that the 2008 amendment, but not the prior Act, author izes the Government to intercept. These communications include discussions with family members of those detained at Guantanamo, friends and acquaintances of those persons, and investigators, experts, and others with knowledge of cir cumstances [CITE_END:DOC008[P030.B04]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P030.B05]] related to terrorist activities. These persons are foreigners located outside the United States. They are not “foreign power[s]” or “agent[s] of . . . foreign power[s].” And the plaintiffs state that they exchange with these per sons “foreign intelligence information,” deﬁned to include in formation that “relates to” “international terrorism” and “the national defense or the security of the United States.” See 50 U. S. C. § 1801 (2006 ed. and Supp. V); see, e. g., App. to Pet. for Cert. 342a, 366a, 373a–374a. [CITE_END:DOC008[P030.B05]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P030.B06]] Second, the plaintiffs have a strong  motive  to engage in, 
and the Government has a strong  motive  to listen to, conver
sations of the kind described. A lawyer representing a cli
ent normally seeks to learn the circumstances surrounding 
the crime (or the civil wrong) of which the client is accused. [CITE_END:DOC008[P030.B06]]

[CITE_START:DOC008[P031.B03]] A fair reading of the afﬁdavit of Scott McKay, for example, taken together with elementary considerations of a lawyer’s obligation to his client, indicates that McKay will engage in conversations that concern what suspected foreign terror ists, such as his client, have done; in conversations that con cern his clients’ families, colleagues, and contacts; in conver sations that concern what those persons (or those connected to them) have said and done, at least in relation to terrorist activities; in conversations that concern the political, social, and commercial environments in which the suspected terror ists have lived and worked; and so [CITE_END:DOC008[P031.B03]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P031.B04]] forth. See, e. g., id ., at 373a–374a. Journalists and human rights workers have strong similar motives to conduct conversations of this kind. See, e. g. , id ., at 342a (declaration of Joanne Mariner, stating that “some of the information [she] exchange[s] by telephone and e-mail relates to terrorism and counterterrorism, and much of the information relates to the foreign affairs of the United States”). [CITE_END:DOC008[P031.B04]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P031.B05]] At the same time, the Government has a strong motive to conduct surveillance of conversations that contain material of this kind. The Government, after all, seeks to learn as much as it can reasonably learn about suspected terrorists (such as those detained at Guantanamo), as well as about their contacts and activities, along with those of friends and family members. See Executive Ofﬁce of the President, Of ﬁce of Management and Budget, Statement of Administra tion Policy on S. 2248, p. 4 (Dec. 17, 2007) (“Part of the value of the [new authority] is to enable the Intelligence Commu nity [CITE_END:DOC008[P031.B05]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P031.B06]] to collect expeditiously the communications of terrorists in foreign countries who may contact an associate in the United States”). And the Government is motivated to do so, not simply by the desire to help convict those whom the Government believes guilty, but also by the critical, overrid ing need to protect America from terrorism. See id., at 1 (“Protection of the American people and American interests at home and abroad requires access to timely, accurate, and [CITE_END:DOC008[P031.B06]]

[CITE_START:DOC008[P032.B02]] insightful intelligence on the capabilities, intentions, and ac
tivities of . . . terrorists”). Third, the Government’s  past behavior  shows that it has 
sought, and hence will in all likelihood continue to seek, in
formation about alleged terrorists and detainees through 
means that include surveillance of electronic communica
tions. As just pointed out, plaintiff Scott McKay states that 
the Government (under the authority of the pre-2008 law) 
“intercepted some 10,000 telephone calls and 20,000 email 
communications involving [his client] Mr. Al-Hussayen.” 
App. to Pet. for Cert. 370a. [CITE_END:DOC008[P032.B02]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P032.B03]] Fourth, the Government has the capacity to conduct elec tronic surveillance of the kind at issue. To some degree this capacity rests upon technology available to the Government. See 1 D. Kris & J. Wilson, National Security Investigations & Prosecutions § 16:6, p. 562 (2d ed. 2012) (“NSA’s technological abilities are legendary”); id., § 16:12, at 572–577 (describing the National Security Agency’s capacity to monitor “ very broad facilities” such as international switches). See, e. g. , Lichtblau & Risen, Spy Agency Mined Vast Data Trove, Of ﬁcials Report, N. Y. Times, Dec. 24, 2005, p. A1 (describing capacity to [CITE_END:DOC008[P032.B03]]

Times, May 12, 2006, p. A1 (reporting capacity to obtain ac cess to records of many, if not most, telephone calls made in the United States); Priest & Arkin, A Hidden World, Grow ing Beyond Control, Washington Post, July 19, 2010, p. A1 (reporting that every day, collection systems at the National Security Agency intercept and store 1.7 billion e-mails, tele phone calls, and other types of communications). Cf.

[CITE_START:DOC008[P033.B03]] omitted)). This capacity also includes the Government’s 
authority to obtain the kind of information here at issue 
from private carriers such as AT&T and Verizon. See 50 
U. S. C. § 1881a(h). We are further told by  amici  that the 
Government is expanding that capacity. See Brief for Elec
tronic Privacy Information Center et al. 22–23 (National 
Security Agency will be able to conduct surveillance of 
most electronic communications between domestic and for
eign points). [CITE_END:DOC008[P033.B03]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P033.B04]] Of course, to exercise this capacity the Government must have intelligence court authorization. But the Government rarely ﬁles requests that fail to meet the statutory criteria. See Letter from Ronald Weich, Assistant Attorney General, to Joseph R. Biden, Jr., 1 (Apr. 30, 2012) (In 2011, of the 1,676 applications to the intelligence court, 2 were withdrawn by the Government, and the remaining 1,674 were approved, 30 with some modiﬁcation), online at http://www.justice.gov/ nsd/foia/foia_library/2011ﬁsa-ltr.pdf. (as visited Feb. 22, 2013, and available in Clerk of Court’s case ﬁle). As the intelli gence court itself has stated, its review under § 1881a is [CITE_END:DOC008[P033.B04]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P033.B05]] “ ‘narrowly circumscribed.’ ” In re Proceedings Required by § 702(i) of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, No. Misc. 08– 01 (Aug. 27, 2008), p. 3. There is no reason to believe that the communications described would all fail to meet the con ditions necessary for approval. Moreover, compared with prior law, § 1881a simpliﬁes and thus expedites the approval process, making it more likely that the Government will use § 1881a to obtain the necessary approval. [CITE_END:DOC008[P033.B05]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P033.B06]] The upshot is that (1) similarity of content, (2) strong mo
tives, (3) prior behavior, and (4) capacity all point to a very 
strong likelihood that the Government will intercept at least 
some of the plaintiffs’ communications, including some that 
the 2008 amendment, § 1881a, but not the pre-2008 Act, au
thorizes the Government to intercept. At the same time, nothing suggests the presence of some 
special factor here that might support a contrary conclusion. [CITE_END:DOC008[P033.B06]]

[Page 34]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P034.B01]] Cite as: 568 U. S. 398 (2013) 
431 Breyer, J. , dissenting [CITE_END:DOC008[P034.B01]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P034.B02]] The Government does not deny that it has both the motive and the capacity to listen to communications of the kind de scribed by the plaintiffs. Nor does it describe any system for avoiding the interception of an electronic communication that happens to include a party who is an American lawyer, journalist, or human rights worker. One can, of course, al ways imagine some special circumstance that negates a vir tual likelihood, no matter how strong. But the same is true about most, if not all, ordinary inferences about future events. Perhaps, despite pouring rain, the streets will re main [CITE_END:DOC008[P034.B02]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P034.B03]] dry (due to the presence of a special chemical). But ordinarily a party that seeks to defeat a strong natural infer ence must bear the burden of showing that some such special circumstance exists. And no one has suggested any such special circumstance here. [CITE_END:DOC008[P034.B03]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P034.B04]] Consequently, we need only assume that the Government 
is doing its job (to ﬁnd out about, and combat, terrorism) in 
order to conclude that there is a high probability that the 
Government will intercept at least some electronic communi
cation to which at least some of the plaintiffs are parties. 
The majority is wrong when it describes the harm threat
ened the plaintiffs as “speculative.” [CITE_END:DOC008[P034.B04]]

[CITE_START:DOC008[P034.B06]] The majority more plausibly says that the plaintiffs have 
failed to show that the threatened harm is “ certainly im
pending .”  Ante , at 409 (internal quotation marks omitted). 
But, as the majority appears to concede, see  ante,  at 414, 
and n. 5,  certainty  is not, and never has been, the touchstone 
of standing. The future is inherently uncertain. Yet fed
eral courts frequently entertain actions for injunctions and 
for declaratory relief aimed at preventing future activities 
that are reasonably likely or highly likely, but not absolutely 
certain, to take place. And that degree of certainty is all 
that is needed to support standing here. [CITE_END:DOC008[P034.B06]]

[CITE_START:DOC008[P035.B03]] The Court’s use of the term “certainly impending” is not to the contrary. Sometimes the Court has used the phrase “certainly impending” as if the phrase described a sufﬁcient, rather than a necessary, condition for jurisdiction. See Pennsylvania v. West Virginia , 262 U. S. 553, 593 (1923) (“If the injury is certainly impending that is enough”). See also Babbitt , 442 U. S., at 298 (same). On other occasions, it has used the phrase as if it concerned when , not whether , an al leged injury would occur. Thus, in Lujan , 504 U. S., at 564, n. [CITE_END:DOC008[P035.B03]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P035.B04]] 2, the Court considered a threatened future injury that consisted of harm that the plaintiffs would suffer when they “soon” visited a government project area that (they claimed) would suffer environmental damage. The Court wrote that a “mere profession of an intent, some day, to return” to the project area did not show the harm was “ imminent ,” for “soon” might mean nothing more than “in this lifetime.” Id., at 564–565, n. 2 (internal quotation marks omitted). Similarly, in McConnell v. Federal Election Comm’n , 540 U. S. 93 (2003), the Court denied standing because the Sena tor’s future [CITE_END:DOC008[P035.B04]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P035.B05]] injury (stemming from a campaign ﬁnance law) would not affect him until his reelection. That fact, the Court said, made the injury “too remote temporally to sat isfy Article III standing.” Id., at 225–226. [CITE_END:DOC008[P035.B05]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P035.B06]] On still other occasions, recognizing that “ ‘imminence’ is concededly a somewhat elastic concept,” Lujan , supra , at 565, n. 2, the Court has referred to, or used (sometimes along with “certainly impending”), other phrases such as “reason able probability” that suggest less than absolute, or literal, certainty. See Babbitt , supra , at 298 (plaintiff “must dem onstrate a realistic danger of sustaining a direct injury” (em phasis added)); Friends of the Earth, Inc. v.

[CITE_START:DOC008[P036.B05]] More important, the Court’s holdings in standing cases show that standing exists here. The Court has often found standing where the occurrence of the relevant injury was far less certain than here. Consider a few, fairly typical, cases. Consider Pennell , supra . A city ordinance forbade land lords to raise the rent charged to a tenant by more than 8 percent where doing so would work an unreasonably severe hardship on that tenant. Id ., at 4–5. A group of landlords sought a judgment declaring the ordinance unconstitutional. The Court held that, to have standing, the landlords had to [CITE_END:DOC008[P036.B05]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P036.B06]] demonstrate a “ ‘ realistic danger of sustaining a direct in jury as a result of the statute’s operation.’ ” Id ., at 8 (em phasis added). It found that the landlords had done so by showing a likelihood of enforcement and a “probability,” ibid. , that the ordinance would make the landlords charge lower rents—even though the landlords had not shown (1) that they intended to raise the relevant rents to the point of [CITE_END:DOC008[P036.B06]]

[CITE_START:DOC008[P037.B04]] Or, consider Blum, supra. A group of nursing home resi dents receiving Medicaid beneﬁts challenged the constitu tionality (on procedural grounds) of a regulation that permit ted their nursing home to transfer them to a less desirable home. Id ., at 999–1000. Although a Medicaid committee had recommended transfers, Medicaid-initiated transfer had been enjoined and the nursing home itself had not threatened to transfer the plaintiffs. But the Court found “standing” because “the threat of transfers” was “not ‘imaginary or speculative’ ” but “quite realistic,” hence “sufﬁciently sub stantial.” Id ., at 1000–1001 (quoting Younger v. Harris , 401 U. [CITE_END:DOC008[P037.B04]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P037.B05]] S. 37, 42 (1971)). The plaintiffs’ injury here is not imagi nary or speculative, but “quite realistic.” Or, consider Davis , supra . The plaintiff, a candidate for the United States House of Representatives, self-ﬁnanced his campaigns. He challenged the constitutionality of an elec tion law that relaxed the limits on an opponent’s contribu tions when a self-ﬁnanced candidate’s spending itself ex ceeded certain other limits. His opponent, in fact, had decided not to take advantage of the increased contribution limits that the statute would have allowed. Id ., at 734. But the Court nonetheless found standing because there was [CITE_END:DOC008[P037.B05]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P037.B06]] a “realistic and impending threat,” not a certainty, that the candidate’s opponent would do so at the time the plaintiff ﬁled the complaint. Id ., at 734–735. The threat facing the plaintiffs here is as “realistic and impending.” Or, consider MedImmune , supra . The plaintiff, a patent licensee, sought a declaratory judgment that the patent was invalid. But, the plaintiff did not face an imminent threat of suit because it continued making royalty payments to the patent holder. In explaining why the plaintiff had standing, [CITE_END:DOC008[P037.B06]]

[CITE_START:DOC008[P038.B02]] we (1) assumed that if the plaintiff stopped making royalty 
payments it would have standing (despite the fact that the 
patent holder might not bring suit), (2) rejected the Fed
eral Circuit’s “reasonable apprehension of  imminent  suit” 
requirement, and (3) instead suggested that a “genuine

threat” is present here. [CITE_END:DOC008[P038.B02]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P038.B03]] Moreover, courts have often found probabilistic injuries sufﬁcient to support standing. In Duke Power Co. v. Caro lina Environmental Study Group, Inc. , 438 U. S. 59 (1978) , for example, the plaintiffs, a group of individuals living near a proposed nuclear powerplant, challenged the constitution ality of the Price-Anderson Act, a statute that limited the plant’s liability in the case of a nuclear accident. The plain tiffs said that, without the Act, the defendants would not build a nuclear plant. And the building of the plant would harm them, in part, by emitting “non-natural radiation into [their] environment.” Id [CITE_END:DOC008[P038.B03]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P038.B04]] ., at 74. The Court found standing in part due to “our generalized concern about exposure to radiation and the apprehension ﬂowing from the uncertainty about the health and genetic consequences of even small emissions.” Ibid .

[CITE_START:DOC008[P039.B04]] How could the law be otherwise? Suppose that a federal

90, percent? [CITE_END:DOC008[P039.B04]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P039.B05]] Would federal courts deny standing to a plaintiff in a di versity action who claims an anticipatory breach of contract where the future breach depends on probabilities? The de fendant, say, has threatened to load wheat onto a ship bound for India despite a promise to send the wheat to the United States. No one can know for certain that this will happen. Perhaps the defendant will change his mind; perhaps the ship will turn and head for the United States. Yet, despite the uncertainty, the Constitution does not prohibit a federal court from hearing such a claim. See 23 [CITE_END:DOC008[P039.B05]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P039.B06]] R. Lord, Williston on Contracts § 63:35 (4th ed. 2002) (plaintiff may bring an anticipatory breach suit even though the defendant’s promise is one to perform in the future, it has not yet been broken, and defendant may still retract the repudiation). E. g., Wis consin Power & Light Co. v. Century Indemnity Co. , 130 F. 3d 787, 792–793 (CA7 1997) (plaintiff could sue insurer that disclaimed liability for all costs that would be incurred in the future if environmental agencies required cleanup); Combs v.

[CITE_START:DOC008[P040.B07]] In some standing cases, the Court has found that a reason
able probability of  future  injury comes accompanied with 
present  injury that takes the form of reasonable efforts to 
mitigate the threatened effects of the future injury or to pre
vent it from occurring. Thus, in  Monsanto Co. , 561 U. S., at 
153–156, the plaintiffs, a group of conventional alfalfa grow
ers, challenged an agency decision to deregulate genetically [CITE_END:DOC008[P040.B07]]

[CITE_START:DOC008[P041.B03]] engineered alfalfa. They claimed that deregulation would 
harm them because their neighbors would plant the geneti
cally engineered seed, bees would obtain pollen from the 
neighbors’ plants, and the bees would then (harmfully) con
taminate their own conventional alfalfa with the genetically 
modiﬁed gene. The lower courts had found a “reasonable 
probability” that this injury would occur.  Ibid.  (internal 
quotation marks omitted). [CITE_END:DOC008[P041.B03]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P041.B04]] Without expressing views about that probability, we found 
standing because the plaintiffs would suffer present harm 
by trying to combat the threat.  Ibid . The plaintiffs, for 
example, “would have to conduct testing to ﬁnd out whether 
and to what extent their crops have been contaminated.” 
Id ., at 154. And they would have to take “measures to mini
mize the likelihood of potential contamination and to ensure 
an adequate supply of non-genetically-engineered alfalfa.” 
Ibid . We held that these “harms, which [the plaintiffs] will 
suffer even if their crops are not actually infected with” the 
genetically modiﬁed gene, “are sufﬁciently concrete to satisfy 
the injury-in-fact prong of the constitutional standing analy
sis.”  Id ., at 155. [CITE_END:DOC008[P041.B04]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P041.B05]] Virtually identical circumstances are present here. Plain
tiff McKay, for example, points out that, when he communi
cates abroad about, or in the interests of, a client ( e. g. , a 
client accused of terrorism), he must “make an assessment” 
whether his “client’s interest would be compromised” should 
the Government “acquire the communications.” App. to 
Pet. for Cert. 375a. If so, he must either forgo the communi
cation or travel abroad.  Id ., at 371a–372a (“I have had to 
take measures to protect the conﬁdentiality of information 
that I believe is particularly sensitive,” including “travel 
that is both time-consuming and expensive”). [CITE_END:DOC008[P041.B05]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P041.B06]] Since travel is expensive, since forgoing communication 
can compromise the client’s interests, since McKay’s assess
ment itself takes time and effort, this case does not differ 
signiﬁcantly from  Monsanto.  And that is so whether we [CITE_END:DOC008[P041.B06]]

[CITE_START:DOC008[P042.B04]] The majority cannot ﬁnd support in cases that use the words “certainly impending” to deny standing. While I do not claim to have read every standing case, I have examined quite a few, and not yet found any such case. The majority refers to Whitmore v. Arkansas , 495 U. S. 149 (1990). But in that case the Court denied standing to a prisoner who challenged the validity of a death sentence given to a differ ent prisoner who refused to challenge his own sentence. The plaintiff feared that in the absence of an appeal, his fel low prisoner’s death [CITE_END:DOC008[P042.B04]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P042.B05]] sentence would be missing from the State’s death penalty database and thereby skew the data base against him, making it less likely his challenges to his own death penalty would succeed. The Court found no standing. Id., at 161. But the fellow prisoner’s lack of ap peal would have harmed the plaintiff only if (1) the plaintiff separately obtained federal habeas relief and was then recon victed and resentenced to death, (2) he sought review of his new sentence, and (3) during that review, his death sentence was afﬁrmed only because it was compared to an artiﬁcially skewed database. Id., [CITE_END:DOC008[P042.B05]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P042.B06]] at 156–157. These events seemed not very likely to occur. [CITE_END:DOC008[P042.B06]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P042.B07]] In  DaimlerChrysler Corp.  v.  Cuno , 547 U. S. 332 (2006),

[CITE_START:DOC008[P043.B03]] We found no standing. But the plaintiffs would have suf
fered resulting injury only if the tax break had depleted 
state and local treasuries and the legislature had responded 
by raising their taxes.  Id ., at 344. [CITE_END:DOC008[P043.B03]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P043.B04]] In Lujan, the case that may come closest to supporting the majority, the Court also found no standing. But, as I pointed out, supra , at 432, Lujan is a case where the Court considered when, not whether, the threatened harm would occur. 504 U. S., at 564, n. 2. The relevant injury there consisted of a visit by an environmental group’s members to a project site where they would ﬁnd (unlawful) environmen tal depredation. Id ., at 564. The Court pointed out that members had alleged that they would visit the project sites “soon.” But it wrote that “soon” [CITE_END:DOC008[P043.B04]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P043.B05]] might refer to almost any time in the future. Ibid ., n. 2. By way of contrast, the on going threat of terrorism means that here the relevant inter ceptions will likely take place imminently, if not now. [CITE_END:DOC008[P043.B05]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P043.B06]] The Court has, of course, denied standing in other cases. But they involve injuries less likely, not more likely, to occur than here. In a recent case, Summers v. Earth Island Insti tute , 555 U. S. 488 (2009), for example, the plaintiffs chal lenged a regulation exempting certain timber sales from public comment and administrative appeal. The plaintiffs claimed that the regulations injured them by interfering with their esthetic enjoyment and recreational use of the for ests. The Court found this harm too unlikely to occur to support standing. Id., at 496. The Court noted that one plaintiff had [CITE_END:DOC008[P043.B06]]
[CITE_START:DOC008[P043.B07]] not pointed to a speciﬁc affected forest that he would visit. The Court concluded that “[t]here may be a chance, but . . . hardly a likelihood , ” that the plaintiff ’s “wanderings will bring him to a parcel about to be affected by a project unlawfully subject to the regulations.” Id ., at 495 (emphasis added).
