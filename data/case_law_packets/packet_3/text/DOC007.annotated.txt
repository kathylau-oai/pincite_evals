[CITE_START:DOC007[P001.B02]] THE  FOURTH CIRCUIT [CITE_END:DOC007[P001.B02]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P001.B03]] No. 80-988. Argued December 1, 1981-Decided February 24, 1982 Section 804 of the Fair Housing Act of 1968 (Act) makes unlawful various forms of discriminatory housing practices. Section 812(a) authorizes civil actions to enforce § 804 and requires that suit be brought within 180 days after the alleged occurrence of a discriminatory practice. A class action for declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief was brought in Federal District Court against petitioners-Havens Realty Corp. (Ha- vens), an apartment complex owner in a suburb of Richmond, Va., and one of its employees-on the basis of their alleged "racial steering" in violation of § [CITE_END:DOC007[P001.B03]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P001.B04]] 804. The suit was brought by a black person (Coles) who, attempting to rent an apartment from Havens, allegedly was falsely told less than 180 days before suit was instituted that no apartments were available, and by respondents-Housing Opportunities Made Equal (HOME), a nonprofit corporation whose purpose was "to make equal opportunity in housing a reality in the Richmond Metropolitan Area," and two individuals (one black and one white) who were employed by HOME as "testers" to determine whether Havens practiced racial steer- ing. The complaint alleged that on specified dates more than 180 days before suit was instituted, the [CITE_END:DOC007[P001.B04]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P001.B05]] black tester was told by Havens that no apartments were available, but the white tester was told that there were vacancies. It was also alleged that Havens' practices had deprived the individual plaintiffs (who were residents of Richmond or the adjacent county) of the "important social, professional, business and economic, po- litical and aesthetic benefits of interracial associations that arise from liv- ing in integrated communities free from discriminatory housing prac- tices"; that Havens' steering practices had frustrated HOME's activities as to housing counseling and referral services, with a consequent drain on resources; and that its members had been deprived [CITE_END:DOC007[P001.B05]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P001.B06]] of the benefits of interracial association arising from living in an integrated community free of housing discrimination. On petitioners' pretrial motion, the Dis- trict Court dismissed respondents' claims, holding that they lacked standing and that their claims were barred by the Act's 180-day statute of limitations. The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded. It held that the allegations of injury to the respondents were sufficient to with- stand a motion to dismiss, and that their claims were not time-barred because petitioners' conduct constituted a "continuing violation" lasting through the time of the alleged Coles incident, which was within the 180- [CITE_END:DOC007[P001.B06]]

[CITE_START:DOC007[P002.B02]] Held: 1. Respondents' claims were not rendered moot by either (1) the Dis- trict Court's entry of a consent order with respect to Coles' claims grant- ing him and the class he represented monetary and injunctive relief, the order having been entered after a trial in which Havens was found to have engaged in unlawful racial steering, or (2) a letter agreement be- tween petitioners and respondents-reached prior to this Court's grant of certiorari-whereby, upon approval by the District Court, respond- ents would each be entitled to $400 in damages and no further relief if this Court were either to [CITE_END:DOC007[P002.B02]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P002.B03]] deny certiorari or to grant it and affirm, but to no relief if this Court were to grant certiorari and reverse. Irrespective of the issue of injunctive relief, respondents continue to seek damages to redress alleged violations of the Act. The letter agreement would merely liquidate those damages. Pp. 370-371. 2. The determination of whether each of the respondents has standing to sue is guided by the decision in Gladstone, Realtors v. Village of Bell- wood, 441 U. S. 91, that Congress intended standing under § 812 of the Act to extend to the full limits of Art. III and [CITE_END:DOC007[P002.B03]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P002.B04]] that the courts accordingly lack authority to create prudential barriers to standing in suits brought under that section. Thus the sole requirement for standing to sue under § 812 is the Art. III minima of injury in fact-that the plaintiff allege that as a result of the defendant's actions he has suffered "a distinct and pal- pable injury." Pp. 372-379. (a) The black individual respondent (Coleman) has standing to sue in her capacity as a "tester." Section 804(d) establishes an enforceable right of "any person" to truthful information concerning the availability of housing. A tester who has been the object [CITE_END:DOC007[P002.B04]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P002.B05]] of a misrepresentation made unlawful under § 804(d) has suffered injury in precisely the form the statute was intended to guard against, and therefore has standing to maintain a damages claim under the Act. That the tester may have ap- proached the real estate agent fully expecting that he would receive false information, and without any intention of buying or renting a home, does not negate the fact of injury within the meaning of § 804(d). If, as al- leged, Coleman was told that apartments were not available while white testers were informed that apartments were available, she has suffered [CITE_END:DOC007[P002.B05]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P002.B06]] "specific injury" from petitioners' challenged acts, and the Art. III re- quirement of injury in fact is satisfied. However, since the white indi- vidual respondent (Willis) alleged that he was informed that apartments were available, rather than that petitioners misrepresented to him that apartments were unavailable, thus alleging no injury to his statutory right to accurate information, he has no standing to sue in his capacity as a tester and, more to the point, has not pleaded a cause of action under § 804(d). Pp. 373-375. [CITE_END:DOC007[P002.B06]]

[Page 3]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P003.B01]] HAVENS REALTY CORP. v. COLEMAN 363 Syllabus (b) Insofar as Coleman and Willis have alleged that the steering practices of petitioners have deprived the two respondents of the bene- fits of interracial association, the Court of Appeals properly held that dismissal was inappropriate at this juncture in the proceedings. It is implausible to argue that petitioners' alleged acts of discrimination could have palpable effects throughout the entire Richmond metropolitan area. But respondents have not identified the particular neighborhoods in which they lived, nor established the proximity of their homes to the site of petitioners' alleged steering practices. In the absence [CITE_END:DOC007[P003.B01]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P003.B02]] of further fac- tual development, it cannot be said as a matter of law that no injury could be proved. Further pleading and proof might establish that the respondents lived in areas where petitioners' practices had an apprecia- ble effect. Pp. 375-378. (c) Although HOME apparently has abandoned its claim of standing to sue for injunctive relief as a representative of its members, it has standing to sue for damages in its own right under the Act. If, as broadly alleged, petitioners' steering practices have perceptibly im- paired HOME's ability to provide housing counseling and referral serv- ices-with a consequent [CITE_END:DOC007[P003.B02]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P003.B03]] drain on the organization's resources-there can be no question that the organization has suffered the requisite injury in fact. Pp. 378-379. [CITE_END:DOC007[P003.B03]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P003.B04]] 3. The 180-day limitations period of § 812(a) of the Act is no bar to the "neighborhood" claims of the individual respondents or to HOME's claim for injury to its counseling and referral services, even though the alleged incidents of racial steering involving Coleman and Willis occurred more than 180 days before suit was filed. Where a plaintiff, pursuant to the Act, challenges not just one incident of conduct violative of the Act, but an unlawful practice that continues into the limitations period, the com- plaint is timely when it is filed within 180 days of the last asserted occur- [CITE_END:DOC007[P003.B04]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P003.B05]] rence of that practice. Here, the individual respondents' "neighbor- hood" claims and HOME's claim are based not solely on isolated incidents involving the two individual respondents but on a continuing violation manifested in a number of incidents-including at least one (involving Coles) that is asserted to have occurred within the 180-day period. However, insofar as Coleman has standing to assert a claim as a "tester," she may not take advantage of the "continuing violation" theory, and such claim is time barred. It is not alleged, nor could it be, that the incident of steering involving Coles deprived Coleman of her [CITE_END:DOC007[P003.B05]]

455  U.  S. [CITE_END:DOC007[P006.B01]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P006.B02]] At the time suit was brought, defendant Havens owned and operated two apartment complexes, Camelot Town- houses and Colonial Court Apartments, in Henrico County, Va., a suburb of Richmond. The complaint identified Paul Coles as a black "renter plaintiff' who, attempting to rent an apartment from Havens, inquired on July 13, 1978, about the availability of an apartment at the Camelot complex, and was falsely told that no apartments were available. App. 13, 7; id., at 15, $ 12.1 The other two individual plaintiffs, Coleman and Willis, were described in the complaint as "tester plain- tiffs" who were employed by [CITE_END:DOC007[P006.B02]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P006.B03]] HOME to determine whether Havens practiced racial steering. Id., at 13, $ 7. Coleman, who is black, and Willis, who is white, each assertedly made inquiries of Havens on March 14, March 21, and March 23, 1978, regarding the availability of apartments. On each oc- casion, Coleman was told that no apartments were available; Willis was told that there were vacancies. On July 6, 1978, Coleman made a further inquiry and was told that there were no vacancies in the Camelot Townhouses; a white tester for HOME, who was not a party to the complaint, was given con- trary information [CITE_END:DOC007[P006.B03]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P006.B04]] that same day. Id., at 16, 13. The complaint identified HOME as "a nonprofit corpora- tion organized under the laws of the State of Virginia" whose purpose was "to make equal opportunity in housing a reality in the Richmond Metropolitan Area." Id., at 13, 8. Ac- cording to the complaint, HOME's membership was "multi- racial and include[d] approximately 600 individuals." Ibid. Its activities included the operation of a housing counseling service, and the investigation and referral of complaints con- cerning housing discrimination. Id., at 14, 8a, 8b.

COLEMAN 363 Opinion of the Court The three individual plaintiffs, who at the time the com- plaint was filed were all residents of the city of Richmond or the adjacent Henrico County, id., at 13, 7, averred that they had been injured by the discriminatory acts of petition- ers. Coles, the black renter, claimed that he had been "de- nied the right to rent real property in Henrico County." Id., at 17, 14. Further, he and the two tester plaintiffs alleged that Havens' practices deprived them of the "important so- cial, professional, business and economic, political [CITE_END:DOC007[P007.B01]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P007.B02]] and aes- thetic benefits of interracial associations that arise from liv- ing in integrated communities free from discriminatory housing practices." Id., at 17, 14, 15. And Coleman, the black tester, alleged that the misinformation given her by Havens concerning the availability of apartments in the Colo- nial Court and Camelot Townhouse complexes had caused her "specific injury." Id., at 16, 13. HOME also alleged injury. It asserted that the steering practices of Havens had frustrated the organization's coun- seling and referral services, with a consequent drain on re- sources. Id., at 17, 16. Additionally, HOME asserted that its members had [CITE_END:DOC007[P007.B02]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P007.B03]] been deprived of the benefits of interra- cial association arising from living in an integrated commu- nity free of housing discrimination. Id., at 17-18, 16. Before discovery was begun, and without any evidence being presented, the District Court, on motion of petitioners, dismissed the claims of Coleman, Willis, and HOME. The District Court held that these plaintiffs lacked standing and that their claims were barred by the Act's 180-day statute of limitations, 42 U. S. C. §3612(a). App. 33-35.1 Each of the dismissed plaintiffs-respondents in this Court-ap- pealed, and the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit re- versed and [CITE_END:DOC007[P007.B03]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P007.B04]] remanded for further proceedings. Coles v. Ha- 'Coles' claims, however, were not dismissed. Rather, they went to trial following the court's certification of a class, represented by Coles, of indi- viduals injured monetarily on or after January 9, 1977, by the steering practices of petitioners.

[CITE_START:DOC007[P008.B02]] vens Realty Corp., 633 F. 2d 384 (1980). The Court of Ap- peals held that the allegations of injury by Willis and Cole- man, both as testers and as individuals who were deprived of the benefits of residing in an integrated community, sufficed to withstand a motion to dismiss.' With respect to HOME, the Court of Appeals held that the organization's allegations of injury to itself and its members were sufficient, at the pleading stage, to afford the organization standing both in its own capacity and as a representative of its members. The Court of Appeals further held that none [CITE_END:DOC007[P008.B02]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P008.B03]] of the allegations of racial steering was time-barred, because petitioners' conduct constituted a "continuing violation" lasting through July 13, 1978-less than 180 days before the complaint was filed. We granted certiorari. 451 U. S. 905 (1981). [CITE_END:DOC007[P008.B03]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P008.B04]] II At the outset, we must consider whether the claims of Coleman, Willis, and HOME have become moot as a result of certain developments occurring after the District Court's dis- missal. The first was the District Court's entry of a consent order with respect to Coles' claims. Following the dismissal of respondents' claims, Coles' undismissed claims went to trial, and Havens was found to have engaged in unlawful ra- cial steering. 7 Shortly thereafter, at the request of the par- ties, the court entered a consent order granting Coles and the class he represented monetary and injunctive relief.

[CITE_START:DOC007[P009.B01]] HAVENS REALTY  CORP.  v.  COLEMAN 363 
Opinion  of  the  Court cerns  an  agreement  reached  between  petitioners  and  re-
spondents  prior  to  this  Court's  grant  of  certiorari. 8  The  let-
ter  agreement,  which  expressly  provides  that  it  is  to  become
effective  only  after  approval  by  the District  Court,  states
that  if  the  Court  were  to  deny  certiorari,  or  grant  it  and  af-
firm,  respondents  would  each  be  entitled  to  $400  in  damages
and  no  further  relief. 
The  agreement  provides  also  that  if
the  Court were  to  grant  certiorari  and  reverse,  respondents
would  be  entitled  to  no  relief whatsoever. [CITE_END:DOC007[P009.B01]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P009.B02]] Despite  these  two  developments,  this  case  is  not  moot.
Irrespective  of  the  issue  of  injunctive  relief, respondents  con-
tinue  to  seek  damages  to  redress  alleged violations  of  the Fair  Housing  Act.' 
The  letter  agreement,  if  approved  by
the District  Court,  would  merely  liquidate  those  damages. [CITE_END:DOC007[P009.B02]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P009.B03]] If respondents have suffered an injury that is compensable in money damages of some undetermined amount, the fact that they have settled on a measure of damages does not make their claims moot.

455  U.  S. III [CITE_END:DOC007[P010.B01]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P010.B02]] Our inquiry with respect to the standing issues raised in this case is guided by our decision in Gladstone, Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, 441 U. S. 91 (1979). There we consid- ered whether six individuals and the village of Bellwood had standing to sue under § 812 of the Fair Housing Act, 42 U. S. C. § 3612,11 to redress injuries allegedly caused by the racial steering practices of two real estate brokerage firms. Based on the complaints, "as illuminated by subsequent dis- covery," 441 U. S., at 95, we concluded that the village and four of the individual [CITE_END:DOC007[P010.B02]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P010.B03]] plaintiffs did have standing to sue under the Fair Housing Act, id., at 111, 115.12 In reaching that conclusion, we held that "Congress intended standing under § 812 to extend to the full limits of Art. III" and that the courts accordingly lack the authority to create prudential barriers to standing in suits brought under that section. Id., at 103, n. 9, 109. Thus the sole requirement for standing to sue under § 812 is the Art. III minima of injury in fact: that the plaintiff allege that as a result of the defendant's actions he has suffered "a distinct [CITE_END:DOC007[P010.B03]]

[CITE_START:DOC007[P011.B03]] The  Court  of  Appeals  held  that  Coleman  and  Willis  have
standing to  sue  in  two  capacities:  as  "testers"  and  as individ-

We
first  address  the  question  of  "tester"  standing. [CITE_END:DOC007[P011.B03]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P011.B04]] In the present context, "testers" are individuals who, with- out an intent to rent or purchase a home or apartment, pose as renters or purchasers for the purpose of collecting evi- dence of unlawful steering practices. Section 804(d) states that it is unlawful for an individual or firm covered by the Act "[tlo represent to any person because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin that any dwelling is not available for inspection, sale, or rental when such dwelling is in fact so available," 42 U. S. C. §3604(d) (emphasis added), a prohi- bition made enforceable through the creation [CITE_END:DOC007[P011.B04]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P011.B05]] of an explicit cause of action in § 812(a) of the Act, 42 U. S. C. § 3612(a). Congress has thus conferred on all "persons" a legal right to truthful information about available housing. [CITE_END:DOC007[P011.B05]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P011.B06]] This congressional intention cannot be overlooked in deter- mining whether testers have standing to sue. As we have previously recognized, "[t]he actual or threatened injury re- quired by Art. III may exist solely by virtue of 'statutes creating legal rights, the invasion of which creates stand- ing .... 1'" Warth v. Seldin, supra, at 500, quoting Linda R. S. v. Richard D., 410 U.

That  the  tester  may  have  approached  the
real  estate  agent  fully  expecting  that  he  would  receive  false
information,  and  without  any  intention  of  buying  or  renting  a
home,  does  not  negate  the  simple  fact  of  injury  within  the
meaning  of  §  804(d). 
See  Pierson  v.  Ray,  386  U.  S.  547,  558

To the contrary, Willis alleged that on each occasion that he inquired he was informed that apartments were available. As such, Willis has alleged no injury to his statutory right to accurate information concerning the availability of housing. We thus discern no support for the Court of Appeals' holding that Willis has standing to sue in his capacity as a tester." More to the point, because Willis does not allege that he was a victim of a discriminatory misrepresentation, he has not [CITE_END:DOC007[P013.B01]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P013.B02]] pleaded a cause of action under § 804(d). We must therefore reverse the Court of Appeals' judgment insofar as it reversed the District Court's dismissal of Willis' "tester" claims. [CITE_END:DOC007[P013.B02]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P013.B03]] B Coleman and Willis argue in this Court, and the Court of Appeals held, that irrespective of their status as testers, they should have been allowed to proceed beyond the plead- ing stage inasmuch as they have alleged that petitioners' steering practices deprived them of the benefits that result from living in an integrated community. This concept of "neighborhood" standing differs from that of "tester" stand- ing in that the injury asserted is an indirect one: an adverse impact on the neighborhood in which the plaintiff resides re- sulting from the steering of persons other than the plaintiff. By contrast, [CITE_END:DOC007[P013.B03]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P013.B04]] the injury underlying tester standing-the de- nial of the tester's own statutory right to truthful housing in- formation caused by misrepresentations to the tester-is a direct one. See Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmen- tal Study Group, 438 U. S. 59, 80-81 (1978). The distinction is between "third-party" and "first-party" standing. [CITE_END:DOC007[P013.B04]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P013.B05]] This  distinction  is,  however,  of  little  significance in  decid-
ing  whether  a  plaintiff  has  standing to  sue  under  §  812  of  the
Fair  Housing  Act. 
Bellwood,  as we have  already  noted,

455  U.  S. [CITE_END:DOC007[P014.B01]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P014.B02]] § 812 is the Art. III requirement of injury in fact. As long as respondents have alleged distinct and palpable injuries that are "fairly traceable" to petitioners' actions, the Art. III re- quirement of injury in fact is satisfied. Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U. S. 252, 261 (1977). The question before us, then, is whether injury in fact has been sufficiently alleged. 1 " The two individual respondents, who according to the com- plaint were "residents of the City of Richmond or Henrico County," alleged that the racial steering practices of petition- ers have deprived them [CITE_END:DOC007[P014.B02]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P014.B03]] of "the right to the important social, professional, business and economic, political and aesthetic benefits of interracial associations that arise from living in in- tegrated communities free from discriminatory housing prac- tices." App. 13, 7; id., at17, 14, 15. Thetype of injury alleged thus clearly resembles that which we found palpable in Bellwood. In that case, plaintiffs alleged that the steering practices of the defendants, by transforming their neighbor- hood in Bellwood from an integrated into an almost entirely black environment, had deprived them of "the social and pro- fessional benefits of living in an integrated society" and had caused [CITE_END:DOC007[P014.B03]]

Opinion  of  the  Court Petitioners  do  not  dispute  that  the  loss of  social,  profes-
sional,  and  economic  benefits  resulting  from  steering  prac-
tices  constitutes  palpable  injury.  Instead, they  contend  that
Coleman  and  Willis,  by  pleading  simply  that  they  were  resi-
dents  of  the  Richmond  metropolitan  area,  have  failed  to  dem-
onstrate  how  the  asserted  steering  practices  of  petitioners  in
Henrico  County  may  have  affected  the  particular  neighbor-
hoods in  which  the  individual  respondents  resided. [CITE_END:DOC007[P015.B01]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P015.B02]] It is indeed implausible to argue that petitioners' alleged acts of discrimination could have palpable effects throughout the entire Richmond metropolitan area. At the time rele- vant to this action the city of Richmond contained a popula- tion of nearly 220,000 persons, dispersed over 37 square miles. Henrico County occupied more than 232 square miles, in which roughly 170,000 people made their homes. 18 Our cases have upheld standing based on the effects of dis- crimination only within a "relatively compact neighborhood," Bellwood, 441 U. S., at 114. We have not suggested that discrimination within a single housing complex might [CITE_END:DOC007[P015.B02]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P015.B03]] give rise to "distinct and palpable injury," Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S., at 501, throughout a metropolitan area. [CITE_END:DOC007[P015.B03]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P015.B04]] Nonetheless, in the absence of further factual develop- ment, we cannot say as a matter of law that no injury could be proved. Respondents have not identified the particular neighborhoods in which they lived, nor established the prox- imity of their homes to the site of petitioners' alleged steering practices. Further pleading and proof might establish that they lived in areas where petitioners' practices had an appre- ciable effect. Under the liberal federal pleading standards, we therefore agree with the Court of Appeals that dismissal have accrued if they had lived with members of minority groups; (3) they bad suffered [CITE_END:DOC007[P015.B04]]

Under the terms of the letter settlement reached between petitioners and respond- ents, however, HOME has agreed to abandon its request for injunctive relief in the event the District Court ultimately ap- proves the settlement.

As petitioners note, although five different specific incidents allegedly in violation of the Fair Housing Act are detailed in the complaint, the four involving Coleman occurred more than 180 days before the complaint was filed, and the fifth, which was within 180 [CITE_END:DOC007[P018.B02]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P018.B03]] days of filing, involved only Coles, whose claims are already the subject of a consent order entered by the District Court. The Court of Appeals, adopting a "continuing violation" theory, held that because the Coles incident fell within the limitations period, none of the claims was barred. [CITE_END:DOC007[P018.B03]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P018.B04]] We agree with the Court of Appeals that for purposes of § 812(a), a "continuing violation" of the Fair Housing Act should be treated differently from one discrete act of dis- crimination. Statutes of limitations such as that contained in § 812(a) are intended to keep stale claims out of the courts. See Chase Securities Corp. v. Donaldson, 325 U. S. 304, 314 (1945). Where the challenged violation is a continuing one, the staleness concern disappears. Petitioners' wooden appli- cation of § 812(a), which ignores the continuing nature of the alleged violation, only undermines the broad remedial intent of Congress [CITE_END:DOC007[P018.B04]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P018.B05]] embodied in the Act, see Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U. S. 409, 417 (1968). Cf. Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., post, at 398. Like the Court of Ap- peals, we therefore conclude that where a plaintiff, pursuant 'The section reads in pertinent part: "A civil action shall be commenced within one hundred and eighty days after the alleged discriminatory housing practice occurred."

Opinion  of  the  Court to  the  Fair  Housing Act,  challenges  not  just  one  incident  of
conduct violative  of  the  Act,  but  an  unlawful  practice  "  that
continues into  the  limitations  period,  the  complaint  is  timely
when  it  is  filed  within  180  days  of  the  last  asserted  occurrence
of  that  practice. [CITE_END:DOC007[P019.B01]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P019.B02]] Applying this principle to the "neighborhood" claims of Coleman and Willis, we agree with the Court of Appeals that the 180-day statute of limitations is no bar. Willis and Cole- man have alleged that petitioners' continuing pattern, prac- tice, and policy of unlawful racial steering has deprived them of the benefits of interracial association arising from living in an integrated neighborhood. Plainly the claims, as currently alleged, are based not solely on isolated incidents involving the two respondents, but a continuing violation manifested in a number of incidents-including at least one (involving Coles) that is asserted to have occurred within [CITE_END:DOC007[P019.B02]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P019.B03]] the 180-day period. HOME, too, claims injury to its counseling and re- ferral services not only from the incidents involving Coleman and Willis, but also from a continuing policy and practice of unlawful racial steering that extends through the last alleged incident. We do not agree with the Court of Appeals, how- ever, that insofar as respondent Coleman has standing to as- sert a claim as a "tester," she may take advantage of the "continuing violation" theory. Her tester claim is, in es- sence, that on four isolated occasions she received false in- formation from petitioners in violation of § [CITE_END:DOC007[P019.B03]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P019.B04]] 804(d). It is not alleged, nor could it be, that the incident of steering involving Coles on July 13, 1978, deprived Coleman of her § 804(d) right to truthful housing information. See App. 16, 13. [CITE_END:DOC007[P019.B04]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P019.B05]] 1  Petitioners read  §  813  of  the  Act,  42  U.  S.  C.  §  3613,  as  permitting  only
the  Attorney  General  to  bring  a  civil  suit under  the  Act  challenging a  "pat-
tern  or  practice"  of  unlawful conduct. 
We  disagree.  That  section  serves
only  to  describe  the  suits  that  the  Attorney  General may  bring,  and  not  to
limit  suits  that  private  parties  may  bring under  §  812.

In  sum,  we affirm  the judgment  of  the  Court  of  Appeals
insofar  as  the  judgment reversed  the  District  Court's  dis-
missal  of  the  claims  of Coleman  and  Willis  as individuals  al-
legedly  deprived  of  the  benefits  of  interracial  association, and
the  claims  of  HOME as  an  organization allegedly  injured  by
the  racial  steering  practices  of  petitioners;  we  reverse  the
judgment  insofar  as  it  directed  that  Coleman  and  Willis  may proceed  to  trial  on  their  tester  claims.  Further  proceedings
on  the  remand  directed  by  the  Court  of  Appeals  shall be  con-
sistent  with  this  opinion. [CITE_END:DOC007[P020.B02]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P020.B03]] It is  so  ordered. [CITE_END:DOC007[P020.B03]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P020.B04]] JUSTICE POWELL, concurring. In claiming standing based on a deprivation of the benefits of an integrated community, the individual respondents al- leged generally that they lived in the city of Richmond or in Henrico County. This is an area of roughly 269 square miles, inhabited in 1978 by about 390,000 persons. Accord- ingly, as the Court holds, it is at best implausible that dis- crimination within two adjacent apartment complexes could give rise to "distinct and palpable injury," Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 501 (1975), throughout this vast area. See ante, at 377. This, to me, is the [CITE_END:DOC007[P020.B04]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P020.B05]] constitutional core of the Court's decision. "Distinct and palpable" injury remains the minimal constitutional requirement for standing in a federal court. [CITE_END:DOC007[P020.B05]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P020.B06]] Although  I  join  the  opinion  of  the  Court,  I  write  separately
to  emphasize  my  concern  that  the  Art.  III  requirement  of  a
genuine  case  or  controversy not  be  deprived  of  all  substance
by  meaningless  pleading. 
Our  prior  cases  have  upheld
standing,  in  cases  of  this  kind,  where  the  effects  of  dis-
crimination  were  alleged  to  have occurred  only  within  "a  rela-
tively  compact  neighborhood."

[CITE_START:DOC007[P021.B01]] HAVENS REALTY CORP. v. COLEMAN 363 POWELL, J., concurring we today reaffirm that limitation. See ante, at 377. I therefore am troubled, not by the opinion of the Court, but by the record on which that opinion is based. After nearly four years of litigation we know only what the individual re- spondents chose to plead in their complaint-that they live or lived within a territory of 269 square miles, within which pe- titioners allegedly committed discrete acts of housing dis- crimination. The allegation would have been equally inform- ative if the area assigned had been the Commonwealth of Virginia. [CITE_END:DOC007[P021.B01]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P021.B02]] In Warth, supra, at 501-502, we noted that a district court properly could deal with a vague averment as to standing by requiring amendment: [CITE_END:DOC007[P021.B02]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P021.B03]] "[I]t  is within  the  trial  court's  power  to  allow  or  require
the  plaintiff  to  supply, by  amendment  to  the  complaint  or
by  affidavits,  further  particularized  allegations  of  fact deemed  supportive  of  plaintiff's  standing.  If,  after  this
opportunity,  the  plaintiff's  standing  does  not  adequately
appear  from  all  materials  of  record,  the  complaint  must
be  dismissed."
The  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure  also  permit  a  defend-
ant  to  move  for  a  more  definite  statement  of  the  claims
against  him: [CITE_END:DOC007[P021.B03]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P021.B04]] "If  a  pleading  to  which  a  responsive  pleading  is  per-
mitted  is  so  vague or  ambiguous  that  a  party  cannot  rea-
sonably be  required  to  frame  a  responsive  pleading, he
may  move  for  a  more  definite  statement  before  interpos-
ing  his  responsive  pleading.  The motion  shall  point  out
the  defects  complained of  and  the  details desired.  If  the
motion  is  granted  and  the  order  of  the  court  is not
obeyed  within  10  days  after  notice  of  the  order  or within
such  other  time  as  the  court  may  fix,  the  court  may
strike  the  pleading  to  which  the  motion  was  directed or
make  such  order  as  it  deems  just."

455  U.  S. [CITE_END:DOC007[P022.B01]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P022.B02]] See  United  States  v.  SCRAP,  412  U.  S.  669,  689-690,  n.  15
(1973)  (Rule  12(e)  motion  would  have  been  appropriate  for
defendants  confronted  with  standing  allegations  "wholly  bar-
ren  of  specifics"). [CITE_END:DOC007[P022.B02]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P022.B03]] In this case neither the District Court nor apparently coun- sel for the parties took appropriate action to prevent the case from reaching an appellate court with only meaningless aver- ments concerning the disputed question of standing. One can well understand the impatience of the District Court that dismissed the complaint. Yet our cases have established the preconditions to dismissal because of excessive vagueness, e. g., Gladstone, Realtors, supra, at 112-115, with regard to standing, and those conditions were not observed. The re- sult is more than a little absurd: Both the Court of Appeals and this Court have been [CITE_END:DOC007[P022.B03]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P022.B04]] called upon to parse pleadings de- void of any hint of support or nonsupport for an allegation es- sential to jurisdiction. [CITE_END:DOC007[P022.B04]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P022.B05]] Liberal  pleading  rules  have  both  their  merit  and  their
price. 
This is  a  textbook  case of  a  high  price-in  terms  of  a
severe  imposition  on  already overburdened  federal  courts  as
well  as  unjustified expense  to  the  litigants. 
This  also  is  a
particularly disturbing  example  of  lax  pleading, for  it  threat-
ens  to  trivialize  what  we  repeatedly  have recognized as  a
constitutional  requirement  of  Art.  III  standing.  See,  e.  g.,
Valley  Forge  Christian  College  v.  Americans  United  for
Separation  of  Church  and  State,  Inc.,  454  U.  S.  464,  472-
473,  475-476  (1982);  Warth,  supra,  at  498. [CITE_END:DOC007[P022.B05]]
[CITE_START:DOC007[P022.B06]] In  any  event,  in  the  context  of  this  case, as  it  reaches  us
after  some  four  years  of confusing  and  profitless  litigation,  it
is  not  within our  province  to  order  a  dismissal. 
I  therefore
join  the  opinion  of  the  Court. [CITE_END:DOC007[P022.B06]]
