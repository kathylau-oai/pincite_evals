Syllabus TRANSUNION LLC v . RAMIREZ CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT No. 20–297. Argued March 30, 2021—Decided June 25, 2021 The Fair Credit Reporting Act regulates the consumer reporting agencies that compile and disseminate personal information about consumers. 15 U. S. C. §1681 et seq. The Act also creates a cause of action for con sumers to sue and recover damages for certain violations. §1681n(a).

that request information about the creditworthiness of individual consumers. Be ginning in 2002, TransUnion introduced an add-on product called OFAC Name Screen Alert. When a business opted into the Name Screen service, TransUnion would conduct its ordinary credit check of the consumer, and it would also use third-party software to compare the consumer’s name against a list maintained by the U. S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of terrorists, drug traffickers, and other serious criminals. If the consumer’s first and last name matched the first and last name of an individual on OFAC’s list, then TransUnion would

<BLOCK id="DOC001.P001.B06">
place an alert on the credit report indicating that the consumer’s name was a “potential match” to a name on the OFAC list. At that time, TransUnion did not compare any data other than first and last names. A class of 8,185 individuals with OFAC alerts in their credit files sued TransUnion under the Fair Credit Reporting Act for failing to use reasonable procedures to ensure the accuracy of their credit files. The plaintiffs also complained about formatting defects in certain mailings sent to them by TransUnion. The parties stipulated prior to trial that only 1,853 class members (including the

class definition.  The internal credit files of the other 6,332 class mem
bers were not provided to third parties during the relevant time period. 
The District Court ruled that all class members had Article III stand
ing on each of the three statutory claims.  The jury returned a verdict 
for the plaintiffs and awarded each class member statutory damages 
and punitive damages.  A divided panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed 
in relevant part. Held : Only plaintiffs concretely harmed by a defendant’s statutory viola tion have Article III standing to seek damages against that private de
fendant in federal court.  Pp. 6–27.

(a) Article III confines the federal judicial power to the resolution of “Cases” and “Controversies” in which a plaintiff has a “personal stake.” Raines v. Byrd , 521 U. S. 811, 819–820. To have Article III standing to sue in federal court, a plaintiff must show, among other things, that the plaintiff suffered concrete injury in fact. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife , 504 U.

Robins , 578 U. S. 330, 340. That inquiry asks whether plaintiffs have identified a close historical or common-law an alogue for their asserted injury. Physical or monetary harms readily qualify as concrete injuries under Article III, and various intangible harms—like reputational harms—can also be concrete. Ibid .

<BLOCK id="DOC001.P002.B06">
“Article III standing requires a concrete injury even in the context 
of a statutory violation.”   Ibid .  The Court has rejected the proposition 
that “a plaintiff automatically satisfies the injury-in-fact requirement 
whenever a statute grants a person a statutory right and purports to 
authorize that person to sue to vindicate that right.”   Id. , at 341. An 
injury in law is not an injury in fact.  Pp. 6–14. (b) The Court applies the fundamental standing requirement of con

(1) In their reasonable-procedures claim, all 8,185 class members maintain that TransUnion did not do enough to ensure that mislead ing OFAC alerts labeling them as potential terrorists were not in cluded in their credit files. See §1681e(b). TransUnion provided third parties with credit reports containing OFAC alerts for 1,853 class members (including the named plaintiff Ramirez). Those 1,853 class members therefore suffered a harm with a “close relationship” to the harm associated with the tort of defamation. Spokeo , 578 U. S., at 341. Under longstanding American law, a person is injured when a defam atory statement “that would

Cite as: 594 U. S. ____ (2021) Syllabus fact. The credit files of the remaining 6,332 class members also contained 
misleading OFAC alerts, but the parties stipulated that TransUnion 
did not provide those plaintiffs’ credit information to any potential
creditors during the designated class period.  The mere existence of 
inaccurate information, absent dissemination, traditionally has not 
provided the basis for a lawsuit in American courts.  The plaintiffs can
not demonstrate that the misleading information in the internal credit
files itself constitutes a concrete harm.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC001.P003.B02">
The plaintiffs advance a separate argument based on their exposure to the risk that the misleading information would be disseminated in the future to third parties. The Court has recognized that material risk of future harm can satisfy the concrete-harm requirement in the context of a claim for injunctive relief to prevent the harm from occur ring, at least so long as the risk of harm is sufficiently imminent and substantial. See Spokeo , 578 U. S., at 341–342 (citing Clapper v. Am nesty Int’l USA , 568 U. S. 398). But TransUnion advances a persua sive argument that the
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC001.P003.B03">
mere risk of future harm, without more, cannot qualify as a concrete harm in a suit for damages. The 6,332 plaintiffs did not demonstrate that the risk of future harm materialized. Nor did those plaintiffs present evidence that the class members were in dependently harmed by their exposure to the risk itself. The risk of future harm cannot supply the basis for their standing. Pp. 16–24.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC001.P003.B04">
(2) In two other claims, all 8,185 class members complained about
formatting defects in certain mailings sent to them by TransUnion. 
But the plaintiffs have not demonstrated that the format of TransUn
ion’s mailings caused them a harm with a close relationship to a harm 
traditionally recognized as providing a basis for a lawsuit in American 
courts.  See  Spokeo , 578 U. S., at 341.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC001.P003.B05">
The plaintiffs argue that TransUnion’s formatting violations created
a risk of future harm, because consumers who received the information 
in the dual-mailing format were at risk of not learning about the OFAC 
alert in their credit files and thus not asking for corrections.  The risk 
of future harm on its own is not enough to support Article III standing
for their damages claim.  In any event, the plaintiffs here made no 
effort to explain how the formatting error prevented them asking for 
corrections to prevent future harm.

The United States as  amicus curiae  asserts that the plaintiffs suf

J USTICE  K AVANAUGH  delivered the opinion of the Court. 
To have Article III standing to sue in federal court, plain
tiffs must demonstrate, among other things, that they suf
fered a concrete harm.  No concrete harm, no standing.
Central to assessing concreteness is whether the asserted
harm has a “close relationship” to a harm traditionally rec

courts—such as physical harm, monetary harm, or various 
intangible harms including (as relevant here) reputational

In this case, a class of 8,185 individuals sued TransUn

The plaintiffs claimed that 
TransUnion failed to use reasonable procedures to ensure

by TransUnion.  For 1,853 of the class members, TransUn

members were  not  provided to third-party businesses dur

thus lack Article III standing to sue on the reasonable-pro

<BLOCK id="DOC001.P006.B04">
In two other claims, all 8,185 class members complained 
about formatting defects in certain mailings sent to them
by TransUnion. But the class members other than the 
named plaintiff Sergio Ramirez have not demonstrated that
the alleged formatting errors caused them any concrete 
harm. Therefore, except for Ramirez, the class members do
not have standing as to those two claims.

<BLOCK id="DOC001.P006.B05">
Over Judge McKeown’s dissent, the U. S. Court of Ap
peals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that all 8,185 class mem
bers have standing as to all three claims. The Court of Ap
peals approved a class damages award of about $40 million. 
In light of our conclusion that (i) only 1,853 class members 
have standing for the reasonable-procedures claim and 
(ii) only Ramirez himself has standing for the two format
ting claims relating to the mailings, we reverse the judg
ment of the Ninth Circuit and remand the case for further 
proceedings consistent with this opinion.

Fair Credit Reporting Act.  84 Stat. 1127, as amended, 15 
U. S. C. §1681  et seq . The Act seeks to promote “fair and
accurate credit reporting” and to protect consumer privacy.

ments are relevant to this case.  First , the Act requires con
sumer reporting agencies to “follow reasonable procedures 
to assure maximum possible accuracy” in consumer reports. 
§1681e(b).  Second , the Act provides that consumer report
ing agencies must, upon request, disclose to the consumer 
“[a]ll information in the consumer’s file at the time of the
request.” §1681g(a)(1).  Third , the Act compels consumer
reporting agencies to “provide to a consumer, with each

TransUnion is one of the “Big Three” credit reporting

Beginning in 2002, TransUnion introduced an add-on

OFAC maintains a list of “specially designated nationals”

businesses avoid transacting with individuals on OFAC’s list. When this litigation arose, Name Screen worked in the following way: When a business opted into the Name Screen service, TransUnion would conduct its ordinary credit check of the consumer, and it would also use third-party software to compare the consumer’s name against the OFAC list. If the consumer’s first and last name matched the first and last name of an individual on OFAC’s list, then TransUnion would place an alert on the credit report indi cating that the consumer’s name was a “potential match” to a name on the OFAC list.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC001.P008.B04">
TransUnion did not compare any data other than first and last names. Unsurprisingly, TransUnion’s Name Screen product generated many false positives.

The following day, TransUnion sent Ramirez a second

In February 2012, Ramirez sued TransUnion and alleged three violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

II, we summarize the requirements of Article III standing—

The “law of Art. III standing is built on a single basic
idea—the idea of separation of powers.”   Raines  v.  Byrd , 521 
U. S. 811, 820 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
Separation of powers “was not simply an abstract generali
zation in the minds of the Framers: it was woven into the 
document that they drafted in Philadelphia in the summer 
of 1787.”  INS  v.  Chadha , 462 U. S. 919, 946 (1983) (inter
nal quotation marks omitted).
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC001.P011.B04">
Therefore, we start with the text of the Constitution.  Ar
ticle III confines the federal judicial power to the resolution 
of “Cases” and “Controversies.” For there to be a case or 
controversy under Article III, the plaintiff must have a 
“‘personal stake’” in the case—in other words, standing. 
Raines , 521 U. S., at 819.  To demonstrate their personal 
stake, plaintiffs must be able to sufficiently answer the 
question: “‘What’s it to you?’”  Scalia, The Doctrine of 
Standing as an Essential Element of the Separation of Pow
ers, 17 Suffolk U. L. Rev. 881, 882 (1983).
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC001.P011.B05">
To answer that question in a way sufficient to establish
standing, a plaintiff must show (i) that he suffered an injury
in fact that is concrete, particularized, and actual or immi
nent; (ii) that the injury was likely caused by the defendant;
and (iii) that the injury would likely be redressed by judicial
relief.  Lujan  v.  Defenders of Wildlife , 504 U. S. 555, 560– 
561 (1992).  If “the plaintiff does not claim to have suffered 
an injury that the defendant caused and the court can rem
edy, there is no case or controversy for the federal court to
resolve.”  Casillas  v.  Madison Avenue Assocs., Inc. , 926

But Spokeo is not an open-ended invitation for federal courts to loosen Article III based on contemporary, evolving beliefs about what kinds of suits should be heard in federal courts. As Spokeo explained, certain harms readily qualify as concrete injuries under Article III. The most obvious are traditional tangible harms, such as physical harms and monetary harms. If a defendant has caused physical or monetary injury to the plaintiff, the plaintiff has suffered a concrete injury in fact under Article III.

In determining whether a harm is sufficiently concrete to qualify as an injury in fact, the Court in Spokeo said that Congress’s views may be “instructive.” 578 U. S., at 341. Courts must afford due respect to Congress’s decision to im pose a statutory prohibition or obligation on a defendant, and to grant a plaintiff a cause of action to sue over the de fendant’s violation of that statutory prohibition or obliga tion.

For standing purposes, therefore, an important difference exists between (i) a plaintiff ’s statutory cause of action to sue a defendant over the defendant’s violation of federal law, and (ii) a plaintiff ’s suffering concrete harm because of the defendant’s violation of federal law. Congress may en act legal prohibitions and obligations. And Congress may create causes of action for plaintiffs to sue defendants who violate those legal prohibitions or obligations.

Even if Congress affords both hypothetical plaintiffs a cause of action (with statutory damages available) to sue over the defendant’s legal violation, Article III standing doctrine sharply distinguishes between those two scenar ios. The first lawsuit may of course proceed in federal court because the plaintiff has suffered concrete harm to her property.

did not often afford federal “cit izen suit”-style causes of action to private plaintiffs who did not suffer concrete harms.

Rev. 1131, 1186–1187 (2009). Moreover, until Abbott Laboratories v. Gard ner , 387 U.

Likewise, until the 20th century, Congress rarely created “citizen suit” style causes of action for suits against private parties by private plain tiffs who had not suffered a concrete harm. All told, until the 20th cen tury, this Court had little reason to emphasize the injury-in-fact require ment because, until the 20th century, there were relatively few instances where litigants without concrete injuries had a cause of action to sue in federal court.

As those examples illustrate, if the law of Article III did not require plaintiffs to demonstrate a “concrete harm,” Congress could authorize virtually any citizen to bring a statutory damages suit against virtually any defendant who violated virtually any federal law. Such an expansive understanding of Article III would flout constitutional text, history, and precedent. In our view, the public interest that private entities comply with the law cannot “be converted into an individual right by a statute that denominates it as such, and that permits all citizens (or, for that matter, a subclass of citizens who suffer no distinctive

We accept the “displacement of the democratically elected branches when necessary to decide an actual case.” Roberts, 42 Duke L. J. , at 1230.

2 A plaintiff must show that the injury is not only concrete but also particularized. But if there were no concrete-harm requirement, the re quirement of a particularized injury would do little or nothing to con strain Congress from freely creating causes of action for vast classes of unharmed plaintiffs to sue any defendants who violate any federal law. (Congress might, for example, provide that everyone has an individual right to clean air and can sue any defendant who violates any air-pollu tion law.)

In sum, the concrete-harm requirement is essential to the Constitution’s separation of powers. To be sure, the con crete-harm requirement can be difficult to apply in some cases. Some advocate that the concrete-harm requirement be ditched altogether, on the theory that it would be more efficient or convenient to simply say that a statutory viola tion and a cause of action suffice to afford a plaintiff stand ing. But as the Court has often stated, “the fact that a given law or procedure is efficient, convenient, and useful in facil itating functions of government, standing alone, will not save it

if it is contrary to the Constitution.” Chadha , 462 U. S., at 944. So it is here. 3 3 The lead dissent would reject the core standing principle that a plain tiff must always have suffered a concrete harm, and would cast aside decades of precedent articulating that requirement, such as Spokeo , Summers , and Lujan . Post, at 9–11 (opinion of T HOMAS , J.). As we see it, the dissent’s theory would largely outsource Article III to Congress. As we understand the dissent’s theory, a suit seeking to enforce “general compliance with regulatory law” would not
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC001.P018.B06">
suffice for Article III standing because such a suit seeks to vindicate a duty owed to the whole commu nity. Spokeo , 578 U. S., at 345 (T HOMAS , J., concurring) (internal quota tion marks omitted). But under the dissent’s theory, so long as Congress frames a defendant’s obligation to comply with regulatory law as an ob ligation owed to individuals , any suit to vindicate that obligation sud denly suffices for Article III. Suppose, for example, that Congress passes a law purporting to give all American citizens an individual right to clean air and clean water, as well
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC001.P018.B07">
as a cause of action to sue and recover $100 in damages from any business that violates any pollution law anywhere in the United States. The dissent apparently would find standing in such a case. We respectfully disagree. In our view, unharmed plaintiffs who seek to sue under such a law are still doing no more than enforcing gen eral compliance with regulatory law. And under Article III and this Court’s precedents, Congress may not authorize plaintiffs who have not suffered concrete harms to sue in federal court simply to enforce general compliance with regulatory law.

We agree with the plaintiffs. Under longstanding Amer ican law, a person is injured when a defamatory statement “that would subject him to hatred, contempt, or ridicule” is published to a third party. Milkovich v.

The 1,853 class members therefore suffered a

TransUnion counters that those 1,853 class members did

not require an exact duplicate. The harm from being la

In any event, it is unavailing. Many Ameri can courts did not traditionally recognize intra-company disclosures as actionable publications for purposes of the tort of defamation. See, e.g., Chalkley v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. , 150 Va. 301, 326–328, 143 S. E. 631, 638–639 (1928). Nor have they necessarily recognized disclosures to printing vendors as actionable publications. See, e.g., Mack v. Delta Air Lines , Inc. , 639 Fed. Appx. 582, 586 (CA11 2016).

tutes a concrete harm, the plaintiffs advance a separate ar gument based on an asserted risk of future harm . They say that the 6,332 class members suffered a concrete injury for Article III purposes because the existence of misleading OFAC alerts in their internal credit files exposed them to a material risk that the information would be disseminated in the future to third parties and thereby cause them harm. The plaintiffs rely on language from Spokeo where the Court said that “the risk of real harm” (or as the Court oth erwise stated, a “material risk of harm”) can

To support its statement that a material risk of future 
harm can satisfy the concrete-harm requirement,  Spokeo
cited this Court’s decision in  Clapper . But importantly, 
Clapper  involved a suit for  injunctive relief . As this Court 
has recognized, a person exposed to a risk of future harm 
may pursue forward-looking, injunctive relief to prevent
the harm from occurring, at least so long as the risk of harm
is sufficiently imminent and substantial. See  Clapper , 568 
U. S., at 414, n. 5;  Los Angeles  v.  Lyons , 461 U. S. 95, 102

But a plaintiff must “demonstrate standing separately for

Arg. 36. 7  TransUnion contends that if an individual is ex
posed to a risk of future harm, time will eventually reveal 
whether the risk materializes in the form of actual harm. 
If the risk of future harm materializes and the individual 
suffers a concrete harm, then the harm itself, and not the 
pre-existing risk, will constitute a basis for the person’s in
jury and for damages.  If the risk of future harm does  not 
materialize, then the individual cannot establish a concrete 
harm sufficient for standing, according to TransUnion.

home from work a quarter mile ahead of a reckless driver

the risk does not materialize and the woman makes it home

Here, the 6,332 plaintiffs did not demonstrate that the
risk of future harm materialized—that is, that the inaccu
rate OFAC alerts in their internal TransUnion credit files 
were ever provided to third parties or caused a denial of 
credit. Nor did those plaintiffs present evidence that the
class members were independently harmed by their expo
sure to the risk itself—that is, that they suffered some other 
injury (such as an emotional injury) from the mere risk that 
their credit reports would be provided to third-party busi

ing for their damages claims based on an asserted risk of
future harm is unavailing.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC001.P026.B05">
Even apart from that fundamental problem with their ar

not factually establish a sufficient risk of future harm to 
support Article III standing.  As Judge McKeown explained 
in her dissent, the risk of future harm that the 6,332 plain
tiffs identified—the risk of dissemination to third parties—
was too speculative to support Article III standing.  951

credit information would be requested by third-party busi

time period. Nor did the plaintiffs demonstrate that there
was a sufficient likelihood that TransUnion would other
wise intentionally or accidentally release their information
to third parties.  “Because no evidence in the record estab

presume a material risk of concrete harm.” 951 F. 3d, at 
1040 (opinion of McKeown, J.).

<BLOCK id="DOC001.P027.B03">
Moreover, the plaintiffs did not present any evidence that
the 6,332 class members even  knew  that there were OFAC 
alerts in their internal TransUnion credit files. If those 
plaintiffs prevailed in this case, many of them would first 
learn that they were “injured” when they received a check 
compensating them for their supposed “injury.”  It is diffi
cult to see how a risk of future harm could supply the basis 
for a plaintiff ’s standing when the plaintiff did not even
know that there was a risk of future harm.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC001.P027.B04">
Finally, the plaintiffs advance one last argument for why the 6,332 class members are similarly situated to the other 1,853 class members and thus should have standing. The 6,332 plaintiffs note that they sought damages for the en tire 46-month period permitted by the statute of limita tions, whereas the stipulation regarding dissemination cov ered only 7 of those months. They argue that the credit reports of many of those 6,332 class members were likely also sent to third parties outside of the period covered by the stipulation because all of the class members requested copies of their reports, and
</BLOCK>

consumers usually do not re quest copies unless they are contemplating a transaction that would trigger a credit check.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC001.P027.B06">
That is a serious argument, but in the end, we conclude
that it fails to support standing for the 6,332 class mem
bers. The plaintiffs had the burden to prove at trial that
their reports were actually sent to third-party businesses. 
The inferences on which the argument rests are too weak

The plaintiffs’ attorneys could have attempted to show that some or all of the 6,332 class members were in jured in that way. They presumably could have sought the names and addresses of those individuals, and they could have contacted them. In the face of the stipulation, which pointedly failed to demonstrate dissemination for those class members, the inferences on which the plaintiffs rely are insufficient to support standing. Cf.

We next address the plaintiffs’ standing to recover dam
ages for two other claims in the complaint: the disclosure 
claim and the summary-of-rights claim.  Those two claims 
are intertwined. 
In the disclosure claim, the plaintiffs alleged that
TransUnion breached its obligation to provide them with 
their complete credit files upon request.  According to the 
plaintiffs, TransUnion sent the plaintiffs copies of their
credit files that omitted the OFAC information, and then in 
a second mailing sent the OFAC information. 
See 
§1681g(a)(1). In the summary-of-rights claim, the plaintiffs 
further asserted that TransUnion should have included an
other summary of rights in that second mailing—the mail
ing that included the OFAC information.  See §1681g(c)(2).

drug traffickers, among other unseemly types.  And, as a 
general matter, Americans are barred from doing business

This distinction mattered not only for traditional com- mon-law rights, but also for newly created statutory ones.

without any specific showing of loss.” T. Cooley, Law of Torts *271. 3 While the Court today discusses the supposed failure to show “injury in fact,” courts for centuries held that injury in law to a private right —————— Congress owes a duty to all Americans to legislate within its constitu tional confines. But not every single American can sue over Congress’ failure to do so. Only individuals who, at a minimum, establish harm beyond the mere violation of that constitutional duty can sue. Cf. Fairchild v. Hughes , 258 U. S. 126, 129–130 (1922) (“Plaintiff has only the right,

3 Etymology is also a helpful guide.  The word “injury” stems from the

was enough to create a case or controversy. B Here, each class member established a violation of his or her private rights. The jury found that TransUnion vio lated three separate duties created by statute. See App. 690. All three of those duties are owed to individuals, not to the community writ large. Take §1681e(b), which re quires a consumer reporting agency to “follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the in formation concerning the individual about whom the report relates.” This statute creates a duty: to use reasonable pro cedures to assure maximum possible accuracy. And that
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC001.P039.B04">
duty is particularized to an individual: the subject of the report. Section 1681g does the same. It requires an agency to “clearly and accurately disclose” to a consumer, upon his request, “[a]ll information in the consumer’s file at the time of the request” and to include a written “summary of rights” with that “written disclosure.” §§1681g(a), (c)(2). Those di rectives likewise create duties: provide all information in the consumer’s file and accompany the disclosure with a summary of rights. And these too are owed to a single per son: the consumer who requests the information.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC001.P039.B05">
Were there any doubt that consumer reporting agencies
owe these duties to specific individuals—and not to the 
larger community—Congress created a cause of action
providing that “[a]ny person who willfully fails to comply” 
with an FCRA requirement “with respect to any  consumer 
is liable to  that consumer .” §1681n(a) (emphasis added). If 
a consumer reporting agency breaches any FCRA duty
owed to a specific consumer, then that individual (not all
consumers) may sue the agency.  No one disputes that each 
class member possesses this cause of action.  And no one 
disputes that the jury found that TransUnion violated each 
class member’s individual rights.  The plaintiffs thus have
a sufficient injury to sue in federal court.

The Court chooses a different approach.  Rejecting this
history, the majority holds that the mere violation of a per
sonal legal right is  not —and never can be—an injury suffi
cient to establish standing.  What matters for the Court is 
only that the “injury in fact be ‘concrete.’”  Ante,  at 8. “No 
concrete harm, no standing.”  Ante,  at 1, 27.
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC001.P040.B03">
That may be a pithy catchphrase, but it is worth pausing to ask why “concrete” injury in fact should be the sole in quiry. After all, it was not until 1970—“180 years after the ratification of Article III”—that this Court even introduced the “injury in fact” (as opposed to injury in law) concept of standing. Sierra v. Hallandale Beach , 996 F. 3d 1110, 1117 (CA11 2021) (Newsom, J., concurring). And the concept then was not even about constitutional standing; it con cerned a statutory cause of action under the Administrative Procedure Act. See Association of Data Processing Service Organizations,

<BLOCK id="DOC001.P040.B04">
Inc. v. Camp , 397 U. S. 150, 153 (1970) (ex plaining that the injury-in-fact requirement “concerns, apart from the ‘case’ or ‘controversy’ test, the question whether the interest sought to be protected by the com plainant is arguably within the zone of interests to be pro tected or regulated by the statute or constitutional guaran tee in question”).
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC001.P040.B05">
The Court later took this statutory requirement and be
gan to graft it onto its constitutional standing analysis.
See,  e.g., Warth  v.  Seldin , 422 U. S. 490 (1975).  But even 
then, injury in fact served as an  additional  way to get into 
federal court. Article III injury still could “exist solely by
virtue of ‘statutes creating legal rights, the invasion of 
which creates standing.’”   Id. , at 500 (quoting  Linda R. S. 
v.  Richard D. , 410 U. S. 614, 617, n. 3 (1973)). So the intro
duction of an injury-in-fact requirement, in effect, “repre
sented a substantial broadening of access to the federal
courts.”  Simon  v.  Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization ,

In the context of public rights, the Court continued to re quire more than just a legal violation. In Lujan v. Defend ers of Wildlife , 504 U.

See id., at 558, 571–572; 16 U. S. C. §1540(g). Echoing the
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC001.P041.B05">
historical distinction between duties owed to individuals and those owed to the community, the Court explained that a plaintiff must do more than raise “a generally available grievance about government—claiming only harm to his and every citizen’s interest in proper ap plication of the Constitution and laws.” 504 U. S., at 573. “Vindicating the public interest (including the public inter est in Government observance of the Constitution and laws) is the function of Congress and the Chief Executive.” Id., at 576. “‘The province of the court,’” in contrast, “‘is, solely, to decide on the rights of individuals.’” Ibid.

The same public-rights analysis prevailed in  Summers  v. 
Earth Island Institute , 555 U. S. 488 (2009).  There, a group
of organizations sought to prevent the United States Forest 
Service from enforcing regulations that exempt certain pro
jects from notice and comment.  Id. , at 490.  The Court, 
again, found that the mere violation of the law “without
some concrete interest that is affected by the deprivation—
a procedural right  in vacuo —is insufficient to create Article 
III standing.”  Id ., at 496. But again, this was rooted in the 
context of public rights: “‘It would exceed Article III’s limi
tations if, at the behest of Congress and in the absence of

added; brackets omitted).
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC001.P042.B03">
In  Spokeo , the Court built on this approach.  Based on a 
few sentences from  Lujan  and  Summers , the Court con
cluded that a plaintiff does not automatically “satisf[y] the
injury-in-fact requirement whenever a statute grants a per
son a statutory right and purports to authorize that person
to sue to vindicate that right.”   Spokeo , 578 U. S., at 341. 
But the Court made clear that “Congress is well positioned 
to identify intangible harms that meet minimum Article III 
requirements” and explained that “the violation of a proce

cumstances to constitute injury in fact.”   Id.,  at 341, 342

Were there any doubt about the facts below, we have the helpful benefit of a jury verdict. The jury found that “De fendant TransUnion, LLC willfully fail[ed] to clearly and accurately disclose OFAC information in the written disclo sures it sent to members of the class.” Id. , at 690. And the jury found that “Defendant TransUnion, LLC willfully fail[ed] to provide class members a summary of their FCRA rights with each written disclosure made to them.” Ibid.

Moreover, to the extent this Court privileges concrete,  fi

ion charged its clients extra to receive credit reports with 
the OFAC designation. According to TransUnion, these 
special OFAC credit reports are valuable.  Even the major
ity must admit that withholding something of value from
another person—that is, “monetary harm”—falls in the 
heartland of tangible injury in fact.  Ante , at 1, 9.  Recogniz

standing to sue if they, like the class members, did not re
ceive the OFAC credit reports they had requested.  Tr. of

And then there is the standalone harm caused by the ra

The question this Court has identified as key, then, is 
whether a plaintiff established “a degree of risk” that is
“sufficient to meet the concreteness requirement.”   Spokeo,
578 U. S., at 343.  Here, in a 7-month period, it is undis
puted that nearly 25 percent of the class had false OFAC-
flags sent to potential creditors.  Twenty-five percent over
just a 7-month period seems, to me, “a degree of risk suffi
cient to meet the concreteness requirement.”  Ibid.  If 25 
percent is insufficient, then, pray tell, what percentage is?
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC001.P046.B04">
The majority deflects this line of analysis by all but elim inating the risk-of-harm analysis. According to the major ity, an elevated risk of harm simply shows that a concrete harm is imminent and thus may support only a claim for injunctive relief. Ante , at 20, 26. But this reworking of Spokeo fails for two reasons. First, it ignores what Spokeo said: “[Our opinion] does not mean . . . that the risk of real harm cannot satisfy the requirement of concreteness.” Spokeo , 578 U. S., at 341. Second, it ignores what Spokeo did. The Court in Spokeo

remanded the respondent’s claims for statutory damages to the Ninth Circuit to consider “whether the . . . violations alleged in this case entail a de gree of risk sufficient to meet the concreteness require ment.” Id., at 342–343. The theory that risk of harm mat ters only for injunctive relief is thus squarely foreclosed by Spokeo itself.

But even if risk of harm is out, the Ninth Circuit indi
cated that every class member may have had an OFAC alert 
disclosed. According to the court below, TransUnion not

Surely with a harm so closely paralleling a common-law

Finally, it is not just the harm that is reminiscent of a constitutional case or controversy. So too is the remedy. Although statutory damages are not necessarily a proxy for unjust enrichment, they have a similar flavor in this case. TransUnion violated consumers’ rights in order to create and sell a product to its clients. Reckless handling of con sumer information and bungled responses to requests for information served a means to an end. And the end was financial gain. “TransUnion could not confirm that a single OFAC alert sold to its customers was accurate.” 951 F. 3d, at 1021,

J USTICE K AGAN , with whom J USTICE B REYER and J USTICE S OTOMAYOR join, dissenting. The familiar story of Article III standing depicts the doc trine as an integral aspect of judicial restraint. The case or-controversy requirement of Article III, the account runs, is “built on a single basic idea—the idea of separation of powers.” Allen v. Wright , 468 U. S. 737, 752 (1984). Rigor ous standing rules help safeguard that separation by keep ing the courts away from issues “more appropriately ad dressed in the representative branches.” Id. , at 751 . In so doing,
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC001.P051.B07">
those rules prevent courts from overstepping their “proper—and properly limited—role” in “a democratic soci ety.” Warth v. Seldin , 422 U. S. 490, 498 (1975); see ante , at 7–8 (T HOMAS , J., dissenting).
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC001.P051.B08">
After today’s decision, that story needs a rewrite.  The 
Court here transforms standing law from a doctrine of judi
cial modesty into a tool of judicial aggrandizement.  It holds, 
for the first time, that a specific class of plaintiffs whom
Congress allowed to bring a lawsuit cannot do so under Ar
ticle III. I join J USTICE  T HOMAS ’s dissent, which explains
why the majority’s decision is so mistaken.  As he recounts, 
our Article III precedents teach that Congress has broad 
“power to create and define rights.”   Ante , at 13; see  Spokeo , 
Inc.  v.  Robins , 578 U. S. 330, 341 (2016);  Lujan  v.  Defenders

500. And Congress may protect those rights by authorizing suits not only for past harms but also for the material risk of future ones. See Spokeo , 578 U. S., at 341–343; ante , at 15 (T HOMAS , J., dissenting). Under those precedents, this case should be easy. In the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Con gress determined to protect consumers’ reputations from in accurate credit reporting. TransUnion willfully violated that statute’s provisions by preparing credit files that falsely called the plaintiffs potential terrorists, and by ob scuring that fact when the plaintiffs requested copies of their files. To say,
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC001.P052.B04">
as the majority does, that the resulting injuries did not “‘exist’ in the real world” is to inhabit a world I don’t know. Ante , at 10. And to make that claim in the face of Congress’s contrary judgment is to exceed the judiciary’s “proper—and properly limited—role.” Warth , 422 U. S., at 498; see ante , at 12–13 (T HOMAS , J., dissent ing).
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC001.P052.B05">
I add a few words about the majority’s view of the risks of harm to the plaintiffs. In addressing the claim that TransUnion failed to maintain accurate credit files, the ma jority argues that the “risk of dissemination” of the plain tiffs’ credit information to third parties is “too speculative.” Ante , at 22. But why is it so speculative that a company in the business of selling credit reports to third parties will in fact sell a credit report to a third party? See also ante , at 15 (T HOMAS , J., dissenting) (noting that “nearly 25% of
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC001.P052.B06">
the class” already had false reports “sent to potential credi tors”). And in addressing the claims of faulty disclosure to the plaintiffs, the majority makes a set of curious assump tions. According to the majority, people who specifically re quest a copy of their credit report may not even “ open[] ” the envelope. Ante , at 25 (emphasis in original). And people who receive multiple opaque mailings are not likely to be “confused.” Ibid. ; but see Niz-Chavez v. Garland , 593 U. S. ___, ___ (2021) (slip op., at 14) (explaining that a “series of

who learn that their credit files label them potential terror
ists would not “have tried to correct” the error.  Ante , at 25. 
Rather than accept those suppositions, I sign up with 
J USTICE  T HOMAS : “[O]ne need only tap into common sense 
to know that receiving a letter identifying you as a potential

I differ with J USTICE T HOMAS on just one matter, unlikely to make much difference in practice. In his view, any “vio lation of an individual right” created by Congress gives rise to Article III standing. Ante , at 7. But in Spokeo , this Court held that “Article III requires a concrete injury even in the context of a statutory violation.” 578 U. S., at 341. I con tinue to adhere to that view, but think it should lead to the same result as J USTICE T HOMAS ’s approach in all but highly unusual cases. As Spokeo
</BLOCK>
<BLOCK id="DOC001.P053.B04">
recognized, “Congress is well po sitioned to identify [both tangible and] intangible harms” meeting Article III standards. Ibid. Article III requires for concreteness only a “real harm” (that is, a harm that “actu ally exist[s]”) or a “risk of real harm.” Ibid. And as today’s decision definitively proves, Congress is better suited than courts to determine when something causes a harm or risk of harm in the real world. For that reason, courts should give deference to those congressional judgments. Overrid ing an authorization to sue is appropriate when but only when Congress could not reasonably have thought that a
