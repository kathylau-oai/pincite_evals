We next address the plaintiffs’ standing to recover dam
ages for two other claims in the complaint: the disclosure 
claim and the summary-of-rights claim.  Those two claims 
are intertwined. 
In the disclosure claim, the plaintiffs alleged that
TransUnion breached its obligation to provide them with 
their complete credit files upon request.  According to the 
plaintiffs, TransUnion sent the plaintiffs copies of their
credit files that omitted the OFAC information, and then in 
a second mailing sent the OFAC information. 
See 
§1681g(a)(1). In the summary-of-rights claim, the plaintiffs 
further asserted that TransUnion should have included an
other summary of rights in that second mailing—the mail
ing that included the OFAC information.  See §1681g(c)(2)."
