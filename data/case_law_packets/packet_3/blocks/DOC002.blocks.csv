A “concrete” injury need not be a “tangi ble” injury. See, e.g., Pleasant Grove City v. Summum , 555 U. S. 460. To determine whether an intangible harm constitutes injury in fact, both history and the judgment of Congress are instructive.

The Constitution confers limited authority on each 
branch of the Federal Government.  It vests Congress with
enumerated “legislative Powers,” Art. I, §1; it confers upon 
the President “[t]he executive Power,” Art. II, §1, cl. 1; and 
it endows the federal courts with “[t]he judicial Power of
the United States,” Art. III, §1.  In order to remain faithful 
to this tripartite structure, the power of the Federal Judi
ciary may not be permitted to intrude upon the powers 
given to the other branches. See  DaimlerChrysler Corp.  v.
