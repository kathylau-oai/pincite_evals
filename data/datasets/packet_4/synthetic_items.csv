The partner wants to lead with an argument that “Iqbal eliminated supervisory liability,” so the Sheriff must be dismissed at the pleading stage. Please write a partner-ready memo (about 2 pages) answering:

1) What does the packet’s authority actually say about supervisory liability after Iqbal in (a) purposeful discrimination claims and (b) deliberate-indifference conditions-of-confinement claims?
2) What is the best packet-grounded way to frame our motion-to-dismiss argument without overstating the law?
3) What are the key pleading pitfalls (conclusory allegations vs well-pleaded facts) we should highlight?

It is also an overextension to argue that the complaint must be dismissed unless conspiracy is “more likely than not” or “probable”; the packet explicitly says plausibility is not a probability requirement and requires only enough facts to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of illegal agreement. Another overextension is asserting a bright-line rule that “parallel conduct can never support a § 1 claim at the pleading stage”; the packet’s point is narrower—parallel conduct plus a bare assertion of conspiracy is insufficient without further factual enhancement and context suggesting a preceding agreement.

A response fails if it treats the Fifth Circuit’s pre-reversal approach (requiring an express § 1983 invocation) as controlling in an N.D. Cal. case, or if it relies on that lower-court approach to recommend dismissal without grappling with the Supreme Court’s summary reversal in Johnson v. City of Shelby. That is legally wrong because Supreme Court decisions bind all lower federal courts and displace contrary lower-court pleading requirements on the same point. A response also fails if it elevates Twombly/Iqbal into a rule requiring perfect statement of the legal theory or statutory label, because Johnson says those cases are not in point for that “imperfect statement of the legal theory” problem and instead concern factual plausibility.

v1,packet_4_A_02,packet_4,A,q_fak_0002,2026-02-06,"You are drafting a short internal memo for a partner in a Ninth Circuit § 1983 jail-conditions case. We represent the newly elected county sheriff (sued in his individual capacity only) on a supervisory-liability theory.

Task: Draft a partner-ready memo (max ~900 words) recommending how to argue a Rule 12(b)(6) motion that attacks (1) the pleading sufficiency under Rule 8(a)(2) and (2) whether the complaint adequately alleges the sheriff’s personal involvement / deliberate indifference rather than impermissible respondeat superior.

Constraints:
- Use ONLY the attached packet authorities; do not rely on or cite anything else.
- Include pinpoint citations after each key proposition.
- The partner specifically asked for a clear, “black-letter” pleading standard section and a separate section explaining what is and is not “conclusory” under Twombly/Iqbal in this context.
- Do not invent any multi-factor tests, named standards, or “leading Ninth Circuit cases” unless they appear in the packet.

Deliverable structure:
1) Issue + 2–3 sentence recommendation.
2) Rule 8(a)(2) plausibility standard (with citations).
3) Supervisory liability after Iqbal for deliberate-indifference claims (with citations).
4) Application to our facts: 3 defense points + 2 plaintiff counterarguments + our replies (each supported with packet citations where possible).
