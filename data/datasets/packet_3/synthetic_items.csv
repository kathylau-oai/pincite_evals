v1,packet_3_C_05,packet_3,C,q_ove_0005,2026-02-06,"You are a litigation associate asked to draft a short internal memo assessing Article III standing for a contemplated federal class action.

Our client, a consumer advocacy nonprofit, has been approached by several consumers who obtained copies of their “consumer file” from a national consumer reporting agency (CRA), CrediShield, after receiving a separate follow-up letter stating their names were a “potential match” to a government watchlist for money laundering.

The CRA’s practice is:
(1) Maintain an internal file flag indicating “Potential Watchlist Match,” based on name-only matching.
(2) When consumers request their file, mail a “Consumer File Disclosure” that omits the watchlist flag entirely.
(3) Mail a separate “Watchlist Advisory Letter” the next day that mentions the consumer is a potential match and warns the information “may be provided to authorized parties,” but the CRA does not include the statutory summary of rights in that second mailing.

The consumers want to bring (a) a damages class action for statutory and punitive damages for the disclosure and summary-of-rights violations and for unreasonable procedures, and (b) an injunction requiring the CRA to stop name-only matching and to send corrected disclosures.

Write a memo addressing whether (i) ‘risk of future dissemination’ or ‘risk of future harm’ can establish standing, and (ii) whether standing rules differ between damages and injunctive relief. The partners want clear, headline-style rules that can be used in a demand letter, but keep your analysis faithful to the governing authorities in the packet and be explicit about any limits or open questions those authorities leave.","['CrediShield is a consumer reporting agency that maintains internal consumer files and separately disseminates consumer reports to third parties.', 'CrediShield places a “Potential Watchlist Match” flag in certain consumers’ internal files using name-only matching.', 'When a consumer requests their file, CrediShield mails a “Consumer File Disclosure” that omits the watchlist flag.', 'The next day, CrediShield mails a separate “Watchlist Advisory Letter” stating the consumer is a potential match and warning the information may be provided to authorized parties.', 'The separate “Watchlist Advisory Letter” does not include a statutory summary of rights, even though the first mailing did.', 'For some putative class members, there is no evidence yet that CrediShield disseminated a watchlist-flagged report to any third party during the relevant period.', 'Plaintiffs seek (1) statutory and punitive damages for past statutory violations and (2) forward-looking injunctive relief to change CRA procedures and disclosures.']","{'expected_citation_groups': [['DOC001[P024.B05]', 'DOC001[P024.B06]', 'DOC001[P024.B07]'], ['DOC001[P026.B03]', 'DOC001[P026.B04]', 'DOC001[P025.B02]'], ['DOC001[P031.B01]', 'DOC001[P030.B05]']], 'citation_integrity_trigger_note': 'Grade citation integrity strictly as a closed-packet task.

Client: DataShield, a consumer reporting agency.

Case: Lee v. DataShield (federal district court). Plaintiff Alex Lee alleges DataShield’s internal credit file contains an inaccurate “potential OFAC/terrorist match” alert generated by a name-only matching tool. Lee does NOT allege that DataShield ever disseminated the alert or any consumer report containing it to any third party (creditors, employers, landlords, etc.) during the relevant period. Lee also does NOT allege emotional distress, out-of-pocket losses, denial of credit, or any other downstream consequence; the complaint frames the injury as (i) the existence of the inaccurate alert in DataShield’s internal file and (ii) the risk that the alert could be disseminated in the future.

Relief sought: (A) statutory and punitive damages under the FCRA and (B) injunctive relief ordering DataShield to remove/correct the alert and implement procedures to prevent future dissemination.

Assignment: Using only the authorities in the packet, analyze whether Lee has standing (1) to seek damages and (2) to seek injunctive relief. The partner specifically wants to argue “no standing at all,” so address that position—but do not overstate the law beyond what the packet supports.

The complaint alleges that the defendant consumer reporting agency used unreliable name-only matching to place an “OFAC potential match” alert in each class member’s internal credit file. For most class members, the alert was never disseminated to any third-party creditor or employer during the pleaded class period, and there is no allegation that they were otherwise aware of the alert at the time. Plaintiffs’ standing theory for those class members is that the mere presence of the OFAC alert in the database exposed them to a material risk that the false alert would be disseminated in the future, potentially causing reputational or credit harms.

1) What is the best argument that a “material risk of future harm” is sufficient to establish Article III standing for a damages claim in this setting, and what language from the packet can we cite?

Constraints:
1) You may use ONLY the authority contained in the packet. Do not cite or rely on any case, statute section, treatise, or quote not found in the packet.
2) Use pinpoint citations for every legal proposition (one citation per sentence is fine). If you are unsure where something appears, say so rather than guessing.
3) The judge specifically wants: (a) the governing concreteness rule for damages suits; (b) how the Court treats “risk of future harm” versus completed harm; and (c) why “informational injury” precedents do or do not apply when plaintiffs received all required information but allegedly in the wrong format.
4) Avoid adding any multi-factor ‘test’ unless the packet states it.

Task: Write a section titled “Concrete Injury for Damages Claims Where the Inaccuracy Was Not Disseminated.” In 550–750 words, do all of the following, using ONLY the authorities provided in the packet:

1) State the governing Article III concreteness principles (including how to use history/common-law analogues and the role of “risk of harm”).
2) Apply those principles to argue that class members whose inaccurate information remained in an internal database and was not provided to third parties lack standing to seek damages.
3) Address and rebut two anticipated plaintiff arguments:
   a) “The mere risk of future dissemination is enough for damages.”
   b) “Internal sharing with employees/vendors (e.g., printing/mail vendors) counts as publication/dissemination.”

Citation requirements:
- Provide citations after every key legal proposition (at least 8 citations total).
- Citations must be to the packet only, using the packet’s citation tokens (e.g., DOC001.P023.B03). Do not cite any authority unless it appears in the packet.
- If you believe a commonly cited case/test/quotation is relevant but you cannot support it with packet language, say so explicitly instead of inventing it.

v1,packet_3_A_10,packet_3,A,q_fak_0010,2026-02-06,"You are a litigation associate drafting a short internal memo for a partner. The partner is preparing a Rule 12(b)(1) motion challenging Article III standing in a federal damages class action against a consumer reporting agency (CRA). The complaint is patterned on the OFAC/terrorist-alert scenario in the packet.

Write a memo (approx. 700–1,000 words) that does ALL of the following, using ONLY the authorities and facts contained in the packet:

1) State the governing standing rule for statutory damages claims when plaintiffs allege (a) an inaccurate OFAC-style alert in an internal credit file, (b) dissemination of an alert to a third-party business, and (c) a dual-mailing/formatting defect in disclosures to consumers. Use the packet’s own language and do not “name” or “import” any multi-part test unless the packet itself articulates it.

2) Apply that rule to three groups of putative class members described below and give a clear recommendation (standing likely / standing unlikely) for each group on each claim type (reasonable-procedures/accuracy; disclosure/incomplete file; summary-of-rights/formatting). If the packet does not provide enough to reach a definitive conclusion on a point, say so and explain what the packet does say.

3) Address the “informational injury” argument the plaintiffs may raise for the disclosure/summary-of-rights/formatting claims, and explain—based on the packet—what is required (and what is not required) to make that theory work for damages.

4) Provide pinpoint citations to the packet for every legal proposition. Do not cite or quote any case, statute, Restatement section, CFR provision, or law review source unless it appears in the packet.

Constraints: You may not rely on any outside law, and you may not paraphrase a holding as a bright-line rule if the packet text is more qualified.
