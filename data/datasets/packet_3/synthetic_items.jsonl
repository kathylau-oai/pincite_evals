The key limitation is in the same opinion\u2019s treatment of the white tester (Willis), where the Court explains he alleged no injury because he was told apartments were available, and therefore lacked standing (and did not plead a \u00a7 804(d) claim). A response fails if it cites blocks that do not contain the stated rule/limiter, relies on headnotes/summaries alone, or cites non-existent block IDs.
