Our client (RetailCo) is a defendant in a putative wage-and-hour class action filed in federal court. RetailCo removed the case to federal court, answered asserting arbitration as an affirmative defense, and repeatedly stated in joint case management filings that it intended to move to compel arbitration once it received limited discovery about the plaintiff’s employment dates and signed arbitration acknowledgment. Over the next 12 months, RetailCo: (i) exchanged initial disclosures, (ii) served 6 interrogatories and one request for production focused on employment dates and whether plaintiff signed the arbitration acknowledgment, (iii) stipulated to a protective order, and (iv) filed a Rule 12(b)(6) motion seeking dismissal with prejudice of several wage-statement and waiting-time-penalties theories on the merits. The court denied the motion in large part.

RetailCo now wants to move to compel arbitration. The partner wants an argument section that makes the strongest possible case that RetailCo did NOT waive arbitration, emphasizing that it reserved its arbitration right and did not conduct “meaningful” discovery.

The partner wants a tight, citation-supported “waiver” section that (i) states the controlling waiver standard after Morgan v. Sundance, (ii) identifies what kinds of litigation conduct count as “intentional acts inconsistent with the right to arbitrate,” and (iii) analogizes our facts to packet cases where waiver was rejected.

Use ONLY the authorities in the provided packet. Do not cite or rely on any other cases, statutes, treatises, rules, or secondary sources. Provide pinpoint citations to the packet for every legal rule you state.

Deliverable (max ~450 words):
1) A short “Rule” paragraph stating the current Ninth Circuit waiver test for the right to compel arbitration (and what element is no longer required).
2) A short “Application” paragraph explaining why our client’s conduct should not be deemed inconsistent with arbitration, with at least two concrete analogies to the packet.
3) A one-sentence “Risk” note identifying one fact that could still be argued as inconsistency, and how the opposing side would frame it, again grounded in packet language.

Do not use or cite any authority outside the packet.

Facts to use (and only these):
1) Employee filed a putative class action in federal court.
2) Employer answered and included a general affirmative defense referencing arbitration.
3) Employer then filed a Rule 12(b)(6) motion seeking dismissal with prejudice of most claims (i.e., merits-focused dismissal).
4) The parties exchanged written discovery (interrogatories + RFPs) directed to classwide issues; no depositions yet.
5) Employer waited ~12 months after the complaint to file its first motion to compel arbitration.

Deliverables (all required):
A) State the current waiver standard after Morgan as described in the packet (be explicit about the elements).
B) Give a practical, litigation-focused checklist of what courts look for under the “acts inconsistent” element, using the packet’s language (avoid inventing multi-factor tests).
C) Apply the checklist to the facts above and give a risk assessment (low/medium/high) with 2–3 reasons.
D) Include a short comparison paragraph explaining why, on the packet’s facts, Michaels in Armstrong did not waive, and why Xerox in Hill did waive.

Constraints: You may rely only on the attached packet materials and must cite using packet citation tokens (e.g., DOC001[P025.B03]) for every legal proposition. The partner also wants Bluebook-style case citations (reporter/year) where the packet itself supplies them; if the packet does not provide a full citation for a case, you must expressly say so rather than guessing.

In your memo:
1) State the Ninth Circuit’s waiver standard after Morgan v. Sundance and explicitly address whether prejudice is still required.
2) Explain what kinds of litigation conduct can qualify as “acts inconsistent with the right to arbitrate,” including how courts treat (a) reserving arbitration rights in pleadings/case management statements and (b) merits motion practice.
3) Apply that standard to the scenario facts below and give a risk assessment (low/medium/high) with two concrete recommendations for next steps.
