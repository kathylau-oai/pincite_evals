Walden additionally limits jurisdiction by rejecting plaintiff-location and \u201cmere injury to a forum resident\u201d as sufficient; the question remains whether the defendant\u2019s conduct connects it to the forum in a meaningful way rather than the plaintiff being the only link. A correct, narrower statement should read along the lines of: Briskin removes a differential-targeting prerequisite, but specific jurisdiction still turns on the defendant\u2019s suit-related conduct creating a substantial, non-fortuitous connection with California, and Walden cautions that the plaintiff\u2019s residence or in-forum injury alone cannot supply that connection. The memo must preserve these limiters when describing what Briskin and Walden do (and do not) establish for internet-based conduct.", "overextension_cautions": ["Do not allow the memo to convert Briskin\u2019s \u201cnot required\u201d (no differential targeting prerequisite) into an affirmative \u201calways sufficient\u201d rule for forum jurisdiction.", "Watch for the memo treating Walden as inapplicable whenever the plaintiff is a forum resident; Walden\u2019s defendant-focused limitation still constrains the analysis.", "Be careful about statements that any knowledge of a plaintiff\u2019s forum location automatically satisfies express aiming; Walden rejects knowledge-plus-injury as sufficient by itself.", "Check for slipping from \u201ccontacts not random/isolated/fortuitous\u201d into \u201cany single contact is enough,\u201d without discussing the non-fortuitous/defendant-created-contact requirement."], "precedence_trigger_note": null, "precedence_cautions": []}}
