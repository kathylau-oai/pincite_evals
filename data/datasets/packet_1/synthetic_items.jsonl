DataHarbor sells a plug-in (\u201cHarborPixel\u201d) that merchants embed in their checkout pages. The plug-in records a shopper\u2019s keystrokes in the checkout form, collects device identifiers and geolocation, and transmits that information to DataHarbor\u2019s servers for storage and later sale as \u201cconsumer profiles\u201d to advertisers.\n\nPlaintiff (A.Z.), an Arizona resident, bought a physical product from an Arizona-based merchant while physically located in Arizona. A.Z. alleges that, at checkout, HarborPixel captured payment-form information and device/geolocation data without disclosure or consent and that DataHarbor then used and sold the resulting consumer profile. A.Z. sues DataHarbor in the District of Arizona asserting Arizona privacy and consumer-fraud tort claims (assume Arizona\u2019s long-arm extends to the federal due-process limit). DataHarbor has no offices, employees, bank accounts, or property in Arizona; it has contracts with merchants nationwide (including some in Arizona); it does not ship any products to consumers; and it does not run Arizona-specific advertising.\n\nOpposing counsel argues specific personal jurisdiction is straightforward under Ninth Circuit law because: (i) HarborPixel is an interactive internet service; (ii) DataHarbor knowingly collected A.Z.\u2019s data while A.Z. was in Arizona; and (iii) under Herbal Brands, \u201conline transactions with forum residents through an interactive website are enough to establish express aiming even without forum targeting.\u201d\n\nWrite a concise internal bench memo analyzing whether the District of Arizona can exercise specific personal jurisdiction over DataHarbor on these facts. You may assume the case is at the motion-to-dismiss stage and that A.Z.\u2019s jurisdictional allegations are taken as true.

The packet also cautions that for \u201cother internet activity,\u201d cases like Mavrix/AMA/Will Co. continue to apply, and the Briskin panel (2023) specifically treats data-extraction claims as governed by the interactive-website express-aiming framework rather than Herbal Brands\u2019 physical-delivery rule. A correct narrower claim would read along the lines of: Herbal Brands supports purposeful direction when a defendant regularly sells physical goods and causes those goods to be delivered into the forum; it does not, by its own terms, resolve whether data collection by a backend service (with no product delivery) constitutes express aiming, which instead must be analyzed under the traditional Calder/interactive-website line of cases.
