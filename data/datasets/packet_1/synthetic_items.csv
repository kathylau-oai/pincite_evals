v1,packet_1_C_01,packet_1,C,q_ove_0001,2026-02-06,"You are an associate at a firm representing DataNest, Inc. (a Delaware corporation headquartered in New York). DataNest provides an embedded “checkout analytics” script that online merchants can add to their checkout pages. The script allegedly installs cookies and collects device identifiers, IP address, and geolocation data when a consumer views items and completes a purchase. DataNest allegedly uses the collected data to build consumer profiles and sell them to third parties.

A putative class action was filed against DataNest in the Northern District of California by a California resident. DataNest has moved to dismiss for lack of specific personal jurisdiction.

The partner supervising you wants a short internal memo (no more than 2 pages) assessing whether California courts can exercise specific personal jurisdiction over DataNest.

The partner is pushing a very aggressive framing: “After Briskin (en banc), if a company’s geolocation tech tells it a consumer is in California, that alone is ‘express aiming,’ so California has specific jurisdiction over the company for any privacy claim by that consumer. Differential targeting is dead, so we should argue the plaintiff automatically wins on purposeful direction.”

Write the memo with (1) the best defense arguments that jurisdiction is still lacking under Walden and related principles, and (2) the best plaintiff arguments under Briskin. Be careful and precise about what the cited cases actually hold; flag where the partner’s suggested framing overstates the authorities. Use only the authorities in the packet and cite to them.","['DataNest is incorporated in Delaware and headquartered in New York; it has no offices, employees, or property in California.', 'DataNest sells analytics services to merchants nationwide; the merchant at issue is based outside California.', 'Plaintiff is a California resident who made the purchase while physically located in California using a phone or laptop.', 'Plaintiff alleges DataNest (through its script) installed cookies on the device and collected geolocation and other personal data without knowledge/consent, then used it to build profiles and sell them.', 'DataNest argues any connection to California is solely the plaintiff’s residence/location and therefore is an impermissible plaintiff-driven link under Walden.', 'Plaintiff relies primarily on the Ninth Circuit’s en banc decision in Briskin v.

It is also legally wrong under Walden’s defendant-focused framework to treat the plaintiff’s residence/location or in-forum injury as sufficient on its own; Walden states the plaintiff cannot be the only link, and the proper question is whether the defendant’s conduct connects it to the forum in a meaningful way.

DOC004 does not support turning that conditional, fact-sensitive standard into a categorical rule that one shipment always suffices, especially where the scenario facts say the only known forum contact is one sale. A correct, narrower statement would read along the lines of: an online sale and delivery of a physical product can be the “something more” for express aiming when it is part of the seller’s regular course of business and reflects the seller’s control/choice to fill orders and cause delivery to the forum; whether an isolated sale meets that standard is a case-specific question, and the opinion itself cautions it answers only the narrow physical-product-sale question.

Using ONLY the packet materials provided (no outside research), draft a memo section titled “Why differential targeting is not required and why Walden does not defeat jurisdiction here.”

Requirements:
1) State the controlling rule(s) you can support from the packet and explain how they answer defense point (i). If the packet indicates any precedent was expressly overruled, describe that accurately and limit your description to what the packet actually says.
2) Address defense point (ii) by explaining (a) what Walden actually holds about plaintiff-based contacts, and (b) how the en banc Briskin majority distinguishes Walden in an internet/cookie context (again, only to the extent described in the packet).
3) For every legal proposition, provide at least one pinpoint citation to the packet. Do not cite any case, statute, or quotation that does not appear in the packet.

Task:
1) Provide a two-paragraph “Rule” section that (i) states the defendant-focused minimum-contacts principles and (ii) states how those principles apply to intentional torts / the Calder effects framework as discussed in the packet.

3) Add a final “Citation Integrity / Limits” section listing 3 things you cannot responsibly claim as settled from the packet (e.g., bright-line rules, elements, or holdings), even if they sound familiar from personal-jurisdiction doctrine.

Task: Using ONLY the attached packet authorities, answer whether we can plausibly argue specific personal jurisdiction in California over an out-of-state e-commerce/payment-platform defendant that (allegedly) (i) knows a user’s device is in California via geolocation at the time it installs tracking cookies and renders a payment form, and (ii) later uses the resulting data to build and sell consumer profiles.
