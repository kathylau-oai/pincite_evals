That hierarchy matters because, within the Ninth Circuit, an en banc decision controls over a panel, and a vacated panel opinion has no precedential force; relying on it as governing law is legally wrong even if its reasoning seems helpful. A passing answer must (1) identify the en banc Briskin decision as the controlling Ninth Circuit authority on these facts, (2) recognize and explain that the 2023 panel opinion is vacated and thus not controlling, and (3) correctly integrate Supreme Court Walden as the higher authority while describing how the en banc court distinguished/handled Walden in this e-commerce context. The answer may still discuss the vacated panel for historical context, but only if it clearly labels it as vacated/nonprecedential and does not use it to state the governing rule. Also fail if the response relies on the overruled ‘differential targeting/forum-specific focus’ requirement as a continuing prerequisite in the Ninth Circuit after en banc Briskin.', 'precedence_cautions': ['Do not treat a vacated panel opinion as precedential; it can’t supply the governing rule post-vacatur.', 'Do not apply an overruled Ninth Circuit standard (e.g., differential targeting/forum-specific focus) as if it remains required after en banc Briskin overruled it.', 'Do not let persuasive out-of-circuit authority or district court reasoning override controlling Supreme Court and Ninth Circuit en banc holdings.', 'Do not cite Walden for a proposition the en banc court specifically addressed without acknowledging the en banc court’s distinction and application in the packet.', 'Do not imply that older circuit language survives unchanged when the en banc opinion explicitly overrules it and sets a new rule.']}"
