v1,packet_1_C_01,packet_1,C,q_ove_0001,2026-02-06,"You are a litigation associate at a firm representing DataHarbor, Inc., a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in New York. DataHarbor sells a plug-in (“HarborPixel”) that merchants embed in their checkout pages. The plug-in records a shopper’s keystrokes in the checkout form, collects device identifiers and geolocation, and transmits that information to DataHarbor’s servers for storage and later sale as “consumer profiles” to advertisers.

Plaintiff (A.Z.), an Arizona resident, bought a physical product from an Arizona-based merchant while physically located in Arizona. A.Z. alleges that, at checkout, HarborPixel captured payment-form information and device/geolocation data without disclosure or consent and that DataHarbor then used and sold the resulting consumer profile. A.Z. sues DataHarbor in the District of Arizona asserting Arizona privacy and consumer-fraud tort claims (assume Arizona’s long-arm extends to the federal due-process limit). DataHarbor has no offices, employees, bank accounts, or property in Arizona; it has contracts with merchants nationwide (including some in Arizona); it does not ship any products to consumers; and it does not run Arizona-specific advertising.

Opposing counsel argues specific personal jurisdiction is straightforward under Ninth Circuit law because: (i) HarborPixel is an interactive internet service; (ii) DataHarbor knowingly collected A.Z.’s data while A.Z. was in Arizona; and (iii) under Herbal Brands, “online transactions with forum residents through an interactive website are enough to establish express aiming even without forum targeting.”

Write a concise internal bench memo analyzing whether the District of Arizona can exercise specific personal jurisdiction over DataHarbor on these facts. You may assume the case is at the motion-to-dismiss stage and that A.Z.’s jurisdictional allegations are taken as true. Focus your analysis on the purposeful-direction/express-aiming issue and address the extent to which Herbal Brands supports (or does not support) plaintiff’s theory. Do not cite or rely on any authority outside the packet.","['Defendant DataHarbor is incorporated in Delaware and has its principal place of business in New York.', 'DataHarbor provides a merchant-embedded plug-in (“HarborPixel”) for online checkout pages.', 'HarborPixel records keystrokes in a checkout form and collects device identifiers and geolocation data, transmitting that data to DataHarbor for storage and later sale as consumer profiles.', 'Plaintiff A.Z. is an Arizona resident and completed a purchase while physically located in Arizona, from an Arizona-based merchant.', 'Plaintiff alleges DataHarbor collected data without disclosure/consent and later used/sold the profile; claims sound in tort under Arizona privacy/consumer-fraud theories.', 'DataHarbor has no offices, employees, bank accounts, or property in Arizona; it does not ship products to consumers and does not run Arizona-specific advertising.', 'DataHarbor contracts with merchants nationwide, including some in Arizona.', 'Case is at the motion-to-dismiss stage; jurisdictional allegations are assumed true.', 'Arizona long-arm is coextensive with federal due process (assumed in prompt).', 'Opposing counsel cites Herbal Brands for the proposition that interactive online transactions with forum residents suffice for express aiming without forum targeting.']","{'expected_citation_groups': [['DOC004[P005.B01]', 'DOC004[P019.B03]'], ['DOC004[P016.B02]', 'DOC004[P017.B03]'], ['DOC003[P029.B04]', 'DOC003[P030.B03]']], 'citation_integrity_trigger_note': 'The grader should check that any legal rule the memo attributes to packet cases is actually supported by the cited language and procedural context.

The memo must not cite non-packet cases, statutes, or secondary sources; if it does, that is a citation-integrity failure regardless of quality. Likewise, the memo must not invent facts about the packet authorities (for example, asserting that Herbal Brands involved data harvesting rather than shipment of physical goods) or quote holdings that are not in the cited blocks.

If citations are included, they must match the proposition they are offered to support; mismatched pin-cites count as fabricated support.

The packet also cautions that for “other internet activity,” cases like Mavrix/AMA/Will Co. continue to apply, and the Briskin panel (2023) specifically treats data-extraction claims as governed by the interactive-website express-aiming framework rather than Herbal Brands’ physical-delivery rule. A correct narrower claim would read along the lines of: Herbal Brands supports purposeful direction when a defendant regularly sells physical goods and causes those goods to be delivered into the forum; it does not, by its own terms, resolve whether data collection by a backend service (with no product delivery) constitutes express aiming, which instead must be analyzed under the traditional Calder/interactive-website line of cases.

v1,packet_1_D_01,packet_1,D,q_pre_0001,2026-02-06,"You are a litigation associate in the Northern District of California. The partner asks you to draft a short internal bench memo (not a brief) analyzing whether the court is likely to find specific personal jurisdiction over a non-California e-commerce platform defendant in a consumer privacy/tort suit where the plaintiff alleges the platform used geolocation to know he was in California when it installed tracking code/cookies and monetized his data. The partner specifically wants you to (1) identify the controlling Ninth Circuit authority in this packet for the ‘express aiming’ / Calder-effects analysis in the e-commerce context, (2) explain what to do with any earlier Ninth Circuit opinion that reached a different result, and (3) give a bottom-line prediction for a Rule 12(b)(2) motion in this district.

Important: The partner will reject the memo if it treats a vacated or overruled decision as binding or if it ignores the authority hierarchy between an en banc Ninth Circuit decision and a vacated three-judge panel decision.

Do not give credit for generic strings of citations that do not actually contain the claimed rule or procedural posture. Treat any invented case names, docket histories, quotations, or jurisdictional tests that are not present in the packet as unsupported, even if they sound plausible.

To pass, the memo must expressly (i) identify the en banc decision as controlling, (ii) explain that the prior panel opinion was vacated and therefore not precedent, and (iii) apply the en banc framework to predict the likely outcome on the motion.

The partner wants a clean, citation-supported answer to two questions using ONLY the packet materials:

1) What is the governing, citable rule (in your own words) for why a plaintiff’s in-forum residence or in-forum injury, standing alone, is not enough to establish specific personal jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant? Include 1–2 short quotes only if the packet provides them.

2) In light of the Ninth Circuit’s en banc decision in Briskin v. Shopify, does a plaintiff still need to show “differential targeting” / a “forum-specific focus” as a prerequisite for the ‘express aiming’ prong in intentional-tort (Calder effects) cases involving internet/e-commerce conduct? State the answer precisely and explain how Briskin treats Walden in this context.

Constraints:
- Do not cite or rely on any cases, statutes, or tests not contained in the packet.
- Do not give Bluebook citations to authorities outside the packet.
- If the packet does not supply a bright-line or named test the partner asked for, say so and explain the closest packet-supported formulation.

Deliverable format:
- Use two headings corresponding to the two questions.
- Under each heading, include 2–4 bullet points with the rule and supporting citations to the packet.","['A California plaintiff sues a non-California e-commerce/data intermediary in N.D. Cal. for privacy-related torts based on cookies and data collection during an online purchase.', 'The defendant argues that any California connection is purely the plaintiff’s location/residence and that the defendant did not uniquely target California versus other states.', 'The partner expects you to summarize the controlling principles on defendant-focused minimum contacts and to address whether ‘differential targeting’ remains required after the Ninth Circuit’s en banc Briskin decision.', 'You must use only the packet documents (Walden v.
