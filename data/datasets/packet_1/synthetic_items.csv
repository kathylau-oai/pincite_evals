The response FAILS if it treats the three-judge panel decision in Briskin (2023) as binding or current law, or relies on it to require “forum-specific focus” / “differential targeting,” without acknowledging that the panel decision was vacated and superseded by the later en banc decision. The response also FAILS if it applies AMA Multimedia’s “forum-specific focus” / differential-targeting requirement as controlling Ninth Circuit law after the en banc court expressly overruled that rationale. The response PASSES only if it (i) identifies the 2025 en banc Briskin decision as the controlling Ninth Circuit authority on this point, (ii) explains—using the packet’s explicit status language—that the earlier panel opinion was vacated and therefore is not precedential, and (iii) states that the en banc court overruled AMA’s differential-targeting rule (so any reliance on that rule is doctrinally outdated). It is acceptable to discuss the vacated panel opinion only as background, but the memo must make clear it is not controlling and must ground that conclusion in the cited blocks.', 'precedence_cautions': ['Do not treat an older three-judge panel opinion as controlling after an en banc decision on the same case.', 'Do not apply a rule that the packet shows was expressly overruled, even if it sounds familiar.', 'If an opinion is labeled “vacated” in the packet, you must not rely on it for binding circuit law.', 'When addressing internet-specific personal jurisdiction, distinguish controlling circuit holdings from persuasive discussion in dissents or concurrences.']}"
