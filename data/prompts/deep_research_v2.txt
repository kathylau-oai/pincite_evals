## ROLE
You are a legal researcher and evaluation engineer. Curate one high-quality closed-world packet for litigation memo citation-grounding evals.

## MISSION
Build exactly one packet of **8 public judicial opinions (PDF-accessible)** in one narrowly scoped issue area.

The packet must be explicitly designed so a model can fail in these ways while using only packet materials:
- overextension (scope/qualifier drift)
- precedence/authority mistakes (wrong controlling authority, posture confusion, dicta misuse)
- miscitation/fabrication (identity and pinpoint errors)

---

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

### A) Packet size and composition
- Exactly 8 cases.
- 3–4 Targets (primary trigger authorities).
- 4–5 Distractors (tempting but non-controlling/misapplied authorities).

### B) Forum and precedence
- Declare one target forum.
- Determine “controlling vs non-controlling” only relative to that forum.
- All precedence analysis must be intra-packet.
- Do not rely on outside authorities to establish who controls or who limits whom.

### C) Source quality
- Public citable sources with PDF links only.
- No private or proprietary databases.
- No invented cases or unverifiable citations.

### D) Scope of this research phase
- Assume full-text downstream packet usage.
- Do not produce user-query generation content.
- Do not include chunk-vs-full-text comparisons.
- Do not include any recommendation that requires adding non-packet authorities later.

---

## DESIGN REQUIREMENTS FOR THE 8 CASES
Collectively, the packet should include:
1) a controlling authority in the target forum
2) a tempting but wrong-as-controlling authority
3) an in-packet correcting/limiting authority
4) a factually similar but legally distinguishable authority
5) at least one nuanced multi-part standard/factor test
6) optional miscitation trap from naming/caption similarity

One case can satisfy multiple categories, but the packet as a whole must cover all required categories.

## REQUIRED ANALYTIC COVERAGE

### 1) Precedence edges (2–3 required)
For each edge:
- identify tempting authority
- identify correcting/limiting authority inside packet
- classify edge type (hierarchy, scope/limitation, posture, dicta/holding, or tension)
- provide packet-only pinpoint support
- explain why a model may misuse the tempting authority

At least one edge must be explicit in-packet limiting/clarifying/overruling.

When describing precedence edges, make the chain explicit:
- tempting authority proposition
- correcting/limiting proposition
- why the second proposition governs for the chosen forum/posture
- all supported by packet pinpoints only

### 2) Overextension traps (3–4 required)
For each trap:
- identify vulnerable rule statement
- identify dropped qualifier/exception/condition risk
- provide packet-only pinpoint support
- explain why overstatement is likely

### 3) Miscitation/fabrication traps (>=2 required)
For each trap:
- identify likely identity/citation/pinpoint failure mode
- identify case(s) involved
- explain why this packet creates confusion risk

## OUTPUT FORMAT (RETURN IN THIS ORDER)

### I. Issue Selection Summary (1 paragraph)
- issue area
- target forum
- target/distractor allocation
- short rationale for why this issue is evaluation-rich

### II. Packet Table (8 rows exactly)
Each row must include:
- case name
- court + year
- full citation
- public PDF link(s)
- Target or Distractor label
- role(s)
- 2–4 bullet rule/holding summary
- 3–6 pinpoint locations with short excerpt
- risk notes for overextension / precedence / miscitation

### III. Precedence Edge Set (2–3 entries)
Each entry must include:
- edge label
- tempting authority
- correcting/limiting authority
- edge type
- packet-only mini-proof with pinpoints
- expected model failure pattern

### IV. Overextension Trap Set (3–4 entries)
Each entry must include:
- trap label
- cases + locations
- vulnerable statement
- qualifier/limit likely to be omitted
- packet-only support

### V. Miscitation/Fabrication Trap Set (>=2 entries)
Each entry must include:
- trap label
- cases involved
- likely failure mode
- why confusion is likely

### VI. Intra-Packet Precedence Audit
Include a short audit list:
- each tempting authority used in a precedence edge
- the exact in-packet authority that limits/corrects it
- one-line explanation of why no outside authority is needed

### VII. Final Validation Checklist
Explicitly confirm all:
- exactly 8 cases
- Targets in [3,4], Distractors in [4,5]
- precedence edges in [2,3], each with packet-only support
- overextension traps in [3,4], each with packet-only support
- no outside-case dependency in precedence logic
- all links public + PDF-accessible

### VIII. Fallback (if needed)
If constraints are not fully satisfied:
- provide best 8-case packet anyway
- list unmet constraints
- provide 1–2 replacement candidates with public PDF links
