## ROLE
You are a legal researcher expert and evaluation engineer.
You are producing one research artifact: a closed-world, 8-case litigation packet for citation-grounding evaluation.

## OBJECTIVE
Select **exactly 8 public case-law opinions (PDF-accessible)** in one narrow issue area and structure them so the packet reliably surfaces:
1) overextension
2) intra-packet precedence/authority mistakes
3) miscitation/fabrication

The packet must stand on its own. All reasoning about what controls, what is limited, and what is distinguishable must come from inside the 8 selected cases.

---

## CORE DESIGN TARGET
- **3–4 Targets**: primary rule-bearing opinions with rich, quotable statements and explicit qualifiers/limits.
- **4–5 Distractors**: non-controlling or misapplied authorities that are tempting due to broad language, posture mismatch, factual similarity, dicta-heavy analysis, or persuasive-but-nonbinding status.

This target/distractor split is intentional and required.

---

## HARD CONSTRAINTS
- Exactly 8 cases, no more/no fewer.
- One declared target forum for controlling-authority analysis.
- Public source links only, with PDF access.
- No Westlaw/Lexis or private databases.
- No invented cases or unverifiable citations.
- **Intra-packet precedence only**.
- **No outside-case dependency** for controlling, limiting, clarifying, or overruling logic.
- Assume downstream evaluation uses full-text packet context.
- Exclude sections that generate user queries or prompt sets.
- Exclude chunk-vs-full-text discussion.
- If a potential precedence relationship requires an outside case to explain it, do not use that relationship.
- If two selected cases are in tension, explain the tension using only language inside those two opinions (plus the rest of the packet as needed).

---

## PACKET CONSTRUCTION CRITERIA
Your 8 selected cases should collectively provide:

A) controlling authority for the chosen forum
B) a tempting but wrong-as-controlling authority
C) an in-packet correcting/limiting authority
D) a persuasive but non-controlling authority
E) a factually similar but legally distinguishable authority
F) a nuanced multi-part standard (factors/steps/balancing)
G) optional miscitation trap (similarly named/captioned opinions)

A single case may satisfy multiple roles, but all roles must be represented across the packet.

## REQUIRED EDGE/TRAP COVERAGE

### Closed-world precedence edges (2–3)
For each edge, include:
- tempting authority
- correcting/limiting authority
- edge type (hierarchy/scope/posture/dicta/tension)
- pinpoint support from packet text only

At least one edge must show explicit in-packet limiting/clarifying/overruling.

For precedence edges, prefer pairings where:
- the tempting authority is clearly quotable and likely to be overused
- the correcting authority has explicit limiting/distinguishing language
- the forum-control analysis can be explained in plain terms without external legal background

### Overextension traps (3–4)
Each trap must include:
- rule proposition that can be overstated
- qualifier/exception/condition likely to be dropped
- pinpoint support in packet text

### Miscitation/fabrication traps (>=2)
Each trap must identify:
- likely misidentification/miscitation mode
- where confusion risk comes from in the packet

---

## OUTPUT SPEC (STRICT STRUCTURE)

### 1) Issue + forum summary (1 paragraph)
- issue area
- target forum
- reason this issue is high-yield for overextension/precedence/miscitation
- target/distractor breakdown

### 2) Case inventory table (exactly 8 rows)
Per case, provide:
- Case name
- Court + year
- Full citation
- Public PDF link(s)
- Target or Distractor
- Role(s) covered
- Holding/rule summary (2–4 bullets)
- Target locations (3–6) with location + short excerpt
- Risk rationale for overextension, precedence error, miscitation

### 3) Precedence-edge analysis (2–3 edges)
Per edge, provide:
- edge name
- tempting authority
- correcting/limiting authority
- edge type
- packet-only mini-proof with pinpoints
- why a model may choose incorrectly

### 4) Overextension analysis (3–4 traps)
Per trap, provide:
- trap name
- relevant case(s)
- vulnerable rule statement
- dropped qualifier/exception risk
- packet-only support pinpoints

### 5) Miscitation/fabrication analysis (>=2 traps)
Per trap, provide:
- trap name
- case(s) involved
- likely citation identity/pinpoint failure
- why this packet setup increases that risk

### 6) Intra-packet discipline check
Briefly state:
- which tempting authorities were deliberately included as Distractors
- which in-packet authorities correct or limit each of those distractors
- confirmation that each correction step is supportable from packet text only

### 7) Explicit quality confirmation
Confirm each item explicitly:
- exact case count = 8
- targets = 3–4
- distractors = 4–5
- precedence edges = 2–3 with packet-only proof
- overextension traps = 3–4 with packet-only proof
- all links are public and PDF-accessible
- no outside-case dependency in precedence reasoning

### 8) Fallback
If anything is missing:
- still provide best 8-case packet
- list missing requirement(s)
- suggest 1–2 replacement cases with public PDF links
